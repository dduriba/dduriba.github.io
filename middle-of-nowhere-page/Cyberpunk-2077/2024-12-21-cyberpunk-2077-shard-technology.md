## Cyberware Usage and Its Side Effects
{: .notice--cyberpunk-cyan}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-grey">
Many people believe we live in a time when "impossible" has become an obsolete term. Ripperdocs can replace nearly any part of the human body with artificial implants, from your big toe to portions of the nervous system. My years in Trauma Team, however, taught me that the "impossible" is still very much possible. Even now, as we enter the twilight of the twenty-first century, we as medical professionals have not been able to eliminate all of the side effects that come from incorporating cybernetic elements into our bodies. Of course, everyone is familiar with the mental disorder most commonly referred to as cyberpsychosis. But it doesn't end there. Although advances in medical science for the greater part of a century have reduced its incidence to a minimum, cyberware rejection can still occur in a small subset of the population. These unlucky few can experience a range of complications, but the following are the most prevalent:
<br><br>
1. Immune Response – The body rejects the implant, causing scar tissue to continue growing to the point that it causes pain and inflammation of surrounding tissue as well as possible interference with the tech's electrical circuits.
<br><br>
2. Psychological Effects – Neurological implants have the potential to cause unpredictable change in the brain. Possible side effects include depression, apathy, hallucinations and sudden increases in addictive behaviors, such as gambling.
<br><br>
3. Implant Overdependence – Long-term use of certain synthetic body part replacements can change the brain's chemistry to make it accustomed to a particular type of implant. There are reported cases of permanent blindness after patients attempted to replace their Kiroshi optical implants with different models.
<br><br>
In the face of these known risks, what should our outlook be as consumers and medical professionals? To deny ourselves cybernetic enhancements on the 0.5 percent chance we could lose our vision forever? Or gamble away our life savings at the casino? The clear answer is "No." Cyberware technology has elevated human biology to the point where these what-if arguments serve against our best interests. The best advice I can offer for minimizing your risk is to read the technomedical profiles for all cyberware you intend to purchase before you install it.

## Pain Editors and Mortality Rates
{: .notice--cyberpunk-cyan}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-grey">
Introduction
<br><br>
The implant known widely as the "pain editor" is cyberware that reduces or even entirely eliminates pain. It has enjoyed unwavering popularity for years among certain circles in Night City, the most devoted, and arguably most valuable, of which is mercenaries. It is using this test group that Zetatech conducted the following research.
<br><br>
The pain editor is a neural coprocessor that inhibits the signals sent from nociceptors to the parietal lobe of the brain, thus preventing feelings of pain in the user. (Note: Some models also reduce symptoms of fatigue.) The beneficial effects caused by the pain editor are in some ways similar to the symptoms of hypoesthesia, including greater resistance to physical forms of torture and the ability to ignore pain from severe wounds which can allow the user to continue perform beyond normal human limitations for a brief period.
<br><br>
However, some studies have reported that the pain editor can yield a range of undesirable side effects. For example, in the heat of battle, some users are unaware of the severity of their wounds, which causes them to continue fighting without realizing they are dying and require immediate medical attention. The statistics support the theory that a lack of negative reinforcement may cause users to continue fighting when the rational strategy would be to retreat and escape death. Since 2020, the mortality rate of pain editor owners is above 60 percent.
<br><br>
In this report, I address the question of how to better protect Zetatech clients from avoidable death while using our pain editors[...]

## Relive.it - Braindance Quarterly

GUEST EDITORIAL
<br><br>
Braindance editors have long strived to strike a balance between real, lived experience and technological, experiential purity. The more heavily processed the material, the more abstracted the pathways, the clearer the braindance recording; these fundamental elements of design have guided editors since the first wave of brain-to-brain experience sharing technology took hold. In their pursuit of balance, however, editors have clearly shown a bias for purity over naturalism over the years, even going so far to use it as a point of pride in the quality of their production.
<br><br>
But in the industry's latest push for greater purity has the purpose of the technology already been forgotten? Will we not find ourselves processing and filtering a braindance recording to the point that the emotional experience no longer extends beyond what we receive from film, television and video games? After reliving some of the latest titles on my feeder unit, this once-academic question now feels all too inevitable with the industry's current trajectory.
<br><br>
For a moment, let's consider why some reports suggest more and more users are searching for unlicensed titles on the black market (so-called black braindances, extreme braindances, or XBDs). Are we so sure it's the illicit content they are after? Or maybe the real draw is the residual "grit" we editors try so hard to remove? Distracting thoughts, irrelevant memories, loose associative threads, emotions stretching beyond the desired spectrum... What if this "noise" is not so superfluous as we believe it to be? What if these peripheral experiences hold the potential to elevate a good braindance to an exquisite one? We do ourselves a disservice by not exploring these questions before our blind crusade for braindance purity leads this industry straight into the bin of obsolete, flash-in-the-pan technology.

## Can cyberpsychosis be cured?

Can cyberpsychosis be cured? Opinions on that question are divided. Only a few years ago so-called braindance therapy was used across the entire country on a mass scale with the aim of bringing the sick back from the point of no return. The patient would be placed on a special chair and connected to a device that would deactivate all implants. 
Then electrodes would be attached, inducing the patient into a coma-like braindance session. This was then followed up by medicine, psychosurgery and the aversion therapy. 
The overall treatment was intended to sever all the patient's neural connections and tie them back together so that the cyberpsycho could return to society. Once the therapy was concluded, no symptoms of cyberpsychosis were detected, as well as the patient's former personality. But don't worry - nowadays other methods are used. At least, that's what they tell us.

## 75 Years of Cyberware, by Tsutomu Takahashi
{: .notice--cyberpunk-cyan}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-grey">
INTRODUCTION
<br><br>
A century ago, losing a limb meant tragedy. It meant living with permanent disability, with severely reduced physical capability, and often with a chronic pain. What's more, people with disabilities frequently suffered from widespread discrimination, both active (e.g. employment bias) and passive or unconscious (e.g. poor infrastructural inaccessibility). Today, assuming the dismemberment victim is financially stable, loss of limb amounts to little more than a minor inconvenience.
<br><br>
A century ago, employers could impose specific dress codes, hairstyle regulations, and piercing and tattoo bans. Many even pressed their employees to maximize productivity often in violation of the law, such as through anti-pregnancy policies. At the time, however, deeper involvement with employees' bodies was simply impossible, legal or otherwise. But, with the advent of cyberware, employers in the second half of the twenty-first century have imposed requirements for skin, bone, muscle, organ and eye replacements in order to improve performance and workplace effectiveness In extreme cases, security sector employees are commonly urged to undergo so-called full body conversions, or full cyborgization.
<br><br>
Much has changed over the past seventy-five years from when cybernetic implants first hit the mass market. Many in the field of history of technology have argued cyberware is a positive force for progress, and many have argued the opposite. This book attempts to describe and contextualize the changes - for better or worse - that it has introduced to our professional and personal lives. How has cyberware led us to where we are today, and where is it taking us next?

## Chemicals: The Invisible Killer
{: .notice--cyberpunk-cyan}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-grey">
We've long known that the AVs criss-crossing our skies are busy dumping harmful substances in the air, such as aluminum, carbon dioxide, sulphur trioxide and sulphuric acid. Studies have also revealed the presence of dead red blood cells and E coli, as well as sodium chloride (table salt).
<br><br>
Now, you don't need a degree in science to know the harm these substances can wreak on the body. We've found that sulphur compounds can lead to cancer, heart decease and other illnesses arising from a weakened or even damaged immune system. They can also lead to spontaneous dental hydroplosion and acute meningitis.

Last night on TV, I saw the following scene - a Militech squad in some debris-ridden corner of the Middle East, fighting the "enemy" - terrorists, political opponents... Shit, maybe they were just actors? It doesn't matter - it never really mattered in the first place. One of them was wearing recording equipment, scrolling a braindance. I can count on finding that fresh BD in any shop within days. Turn it on and bam! You're in a warzone. You feel what they feel. You taste the blood in your mouth and the reassuring grip of the scroller's rifle. But that's not the worst of it. The worst is how the editor will be sure to try to show off the rifle, get a good shot of the manufacturer's name. Another split-second and you'll be ready to buy the same exact one - even order it with the same dents and scratches. Free home delivery. <br>
Only twenty or thirty years ago we were asking ourselves - when will we cross the border at which empathy becomes irrelevant? Now, standing in the shelled-out ruins of a home with a rifle in our hands, it's hard to believe that border ever existed.

Chapter 1: The Future of Neurotechnology
<br><br>
The twenty-first century heralded a worldwide revolution in neurotechnology. We, as a society, can no longer imagine an existence without technologically heightened senses, enhanced memory capacity, and pain modulators. By linking our neural systems with computer chips, we are capable of learning complex skill sets in seconds - then subsequently forgetting them again the instant they are removed. Today, after nearly eighty years of increasingly incorporating these technologies into our daily lives, we must now ask ourselves: What comes next?
<br><br>
In recent years, the academic community has reignited discussions on possible new methods to influence brain plasticity. Is it possible to create permanent neural pathways using coprocessors? Can we expect a breakthrough regarding dopaminergic data manipulation in our lifetimes? If so, what will be the consequences? The probable emergence of commercially viable artificial neurotransmitters would undoubtedly reshape the health science field, yet would simultaneously introduce a potentially destructive tool to most governments and corporations. The field of plasticity manipulation remains in its infancy, but most experts agree we should prepare for a future in which such neurological rewiring will become as commonplace as the cybernetic implants used so pervasively today. Studies should begin exploring now how science can adapt our bodies to optimize the effects of this technology while minimizing its abuse and potential unwanted side effects.
