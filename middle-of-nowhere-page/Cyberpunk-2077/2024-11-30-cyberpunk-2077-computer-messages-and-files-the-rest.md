Dear Viktor,<br>
My name is Abigail Eden and I'm a headhunter for Biotechnica. I was wondering if maybe you'd consider joining the world's most socially conscious, environmentally-friendly corporate family?<br>
We offer full access to our state-of-the-art technology, security(you won't have to relocate from Watson) and an attractive career path.<br>
Let me know. It's worth it.<br>

hey, saw that Zen master again (if he really even is a Zen master). he was sitting in front of the subway entrance. I waited to see what would happen - to see if he'd really disappear or if Sweet Peggy was just seeing things, but of course nobody came up to him, like he wasn't even there. seriously, though - you see a guy wearing Zen master's clothes and you don't even bat an eye? super weird. so anyway, I just stared at him. nothing happened, so I gave up. but the next time I'll nail the bastard. it's some kinda scam - gotta be.

Hey choom. Today is your unlucky day.
<br><br>
U prolly wondering who I am. I'm a Voodoo Boy, prolly heard of us. Remember last time you hit the Net? Yeah? Me too. I hack ur coprocessor and install a little surprise 4 u. Now you do what I say or your head goes BOOM.<br>
I think €$1000 is fair pay to keep ur head. if u pay, I uninstall my surprise. If not, I blow up your head, but blow up the head of person you love the most first. And if you tell NCPD, I blow up your head TWICE.<br>
U have 2 days to pay. And I know you read this cuz I install spycam in your optics. We read it together.<br>
This is not a negotiation, choom, so do not reply. Just pay and u will live.

Dear Good Samaritan,<br>
I am desperate for your help. My name is Loviisa Kaukonen. I recently lost my job as a custodian at Euro Business Machines because I was in a horrible accident last May. Now my implants are no longer compatible with my nervous system. I lost function in both legs, right eye and my left hand. Surgery is too expensive for me. My daughter is very ill and my new baby is blind and deaf. It is my dream to show her the world, but I know I cannot afford treatment for both of us. I humbly ask you for a small donation to buy new Kiroshi eyes so that my little angel can see her mother and sister for the first time.<br>
I will not forget your mercy and generosity,
<br><br>
Loviisa Kaukonen

<hr class="cyberpunk-hr">
A certain corpo entered the Net one night when suddenly everything glitched and he encountered a red demon who said: "Tomorrow at midnight you will be dead." The corpo did not place any faith in the threat and slept soundly that night after leaving the Net. The next day, he went to work and returned home and nothing bad happened. But the next morning his daughter went to wake him up, his optical implants were burned out, his entire body was scorched and cut in half. If you break this email chain, the same thing will happen to you tomorrow at midnight. If you send this to only 3 people, the demon will hurt someone you love. If you send this to 15, the demon will follow you on the Net for 5 days but do nothing to you. If you send this to all of your contacts, your biggest dream will come true.<br>
It's true – it happened to my uncle!
<br><br>
I'm very sorry to send this on to you, but someone sent it to me first. It sounds silly but forwarding this email will save your life!

## Your Inheritance - Urgent reply needed
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg">
<span class="cyberpunk-blue pen-bold">Your Inheritance - Urgent reply needed</span>
<span class="cyberpunk-cyan">
<hr class="cyberpunk-hr">
<span class="pen-bold">From: Sanne Douwes</span>
<br><br>
<span class="pen-bold">To: [ENCRYPTED]</span>
<hr class="cyberpunk-hr">
Dear Sir or Madam,<br>
My name is Sanne Douwes, and I work for Wet en Rechtvaardigheid. I found your address on the client list for Zetatech's Dutch office. Your name happens to be identical to that of my former client, who died tragically in the recent floods ravaging the north of Europe.<br>
Please excuse the rather informal nature of this email, but the matter is truly urgent. My client has left behind 10.7 billion eurodollars in cash. In accordance with local law, the government will assume the entire sum if an heir is not found within a week. I also have it from unofficial sources that the funds will be earmarked for the local branch of Euro Business Machines, which plans to take over Amsterdam.<br>
But we can stop them. I know you are not related to my client by blood, but by taking advantage of a few legal loopholes, we could inherit his fortune and split it three ways - 40% for you, 40% for me, and the remaining 20% for the flood victims, of course.<br>
Please respond to this message within 3 days. Otherwise, I will have to look elsewhere for help.
<br><br>
Sincerely,<br>
Sanne Douwes
