## The Solo's Manual by Morgan Blackhand
{: .notice--cyberpunk-cyan}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-grey">
INTRO
<br><br>
Think you've got what it takes to be a legendary solo, huh? Sure you do. Otherwise, why pick up this book? You're looking for respect. For fear. For a way to be on top. Maybe you heard someone quote me about winning battles with only a glance, before a single shot's been fired. Well fine, I'll let you in on a secret: it is possible, and you can do it too, but only if you got the guts to survive going to hell and back more times than you can count. Thousands of fights, millions of bullets, hundreds of gallons of blood (yours included) - that's what you have to look forward to. And you'll need a solid ripper - one you can trust, one you make a lifelong choombattas out of, one who tells you every week, "It's a miracle you ain't dead by now." At least, that's what he'll say if you're lucky.
<br><br>
Nowadays, every kid with big iron, a syn-leather coat and a micro-missile launcher thinks they're a hotshot solo. But you know what? Just because you killed a few goons with a smile on your lips don't make you one. Anyone can kill. I knew this rockerboy once who blew up a whole fucking platoon of corpotrash. Did that make him a solo? No, it made him dead.
<br><br>
So, still think you got what it takes to carve your name into solo history?
<br><br>
Good. Then this book's for you.

## Kibble and Scop
{: .notice--cyberpunk-cyan}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-grey">
Kibble stared glumly at his glass of a seaweed-colored drink. A part of him hoped the bartender had poured a pint of rat poison by mistake. "I don't get it, choom...", he murmured gloomily. "At school, they said I had talent, a real knack for acting. Was it all a fucking lie, or what?"
<br><br>
"Dude, there are billions of people on this rock," Scop shrugged. "Can't work out for everyone."
<br><br>
Kibble flicked on his olfactory booster and gave his beverage a whiff. Smelled just like the wet mop in the bathroom - maybe worse. Then, not knowing why, he suddenly recalled the merc he talked to a week ago in a popular punk dive he liked to frequent. Well, okay, maybe "talked" is generous, but grievances were certainly aired. The merc swept the floor with him that night and threatened to put a bullet between his tonsils if he ever spilled her tequila again.
<br><br>
This is it, he thought. Rotgut and tequila. Unemployed losers and hotshit mercs. The latter with the world at their feet. It's people like Kibble who are just a theater set piece, who make up the backdrop against which the Sandevistan-boosted mercs of the world can shine bright as stars. Kibble decided then and there that he didn't want to be just a splotch in the background anymore.
<br><br>
"Why? Why doesn't it ever shake out for us?", he asked with sour grimace. "Why does this city only reward bloodthirsty, bulletcrazy punks while the rest of us normal saps without murderous tendencies have to huddle over our cheap glasses of green cockroach piss?"
<br><br>
Scop shrugged again. "I dunno, find a gun, buy an edgy jacket," he suggested indifferently with a note of sarcasm. "Shoot up some gang haunts. Have the punkiest time of your life for four and a half seconds."
<br><br>
"What the hell happened here?" Kibble continued his rant. "The world's all upside-down! There are billions just like you and me. Billions of do-nothings, cowards... No, not cowards - people who just want things to be normal! Safety. Life... Life, Scop!"
<br><br>
Scop had already opened his mouth, ready to list off another round of cynical retorts, but then stopped himself short and started a tangent of his own. "Life..." he repeated slowly and ponderously. "What if I could sell the world... an alternate life? The same all those edgerunners feel, except where you won't ever die like they do."
<br><br>
Kibble snorted and spat out the cockroach piss he finally mustered the courage to taste. "Sorry to burst your bubble, choom, but somebody's way ahead of ya there. Ever heard of Bloody Bout IV? Or, like... a million other computer games?"
<br><br>
Scop cracked a roguish smile. "Is Bloody Bout IV or these 'million other games' designed to work on a hybrid braindance system? Y'know, the kind I made a breakthrough on just last week?"

## 1,000 Beats a Second
{: .notice--cyberpunk-cyan}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-grey"> 
I couldn't believe my eyes. For a moment, I thought Jessica had changed them out for faulty Kiroshis while I was asleep. But no, that wouldn't have been like her. I blinked again. No change. There I saw them, clear as day, the open flaps of Jason's chrome skull. I saw the electronic brain that, up until now, had been hidden by perfect imitation syn-skin.
<br><br>
The son of FutureTech CEO, the boy of my damn dreams, Jason... He was an android. Shit...
<br><br>
I sat there stuck with a dumb expression on my face and Jason stared back with one of his own. I couldn't help but wonder now... were those beautiful blue eyes of his - the same that had pierced my soul - were they merely a mimicry controlled by some emo-algorithm? Had there never been anything real behind them all those times? ... Not once?
<br><br>
"Alex!...I-it's not what you think!" he pleaded with a strangely authentic note of panic in his voice. And I wanted to believe him. I really did.
<br><br>
"Hmph... Well, clearly it hasn't been," I replied in equal parts anxious and bitter. "Me and my rotten luck... The first and last guy I fall for and he turns out to be a goddamn motherboard on legs!"
<br><br>
"No, that's not--," Jason suddenly broke off and smiled awkwardly. "Wait, did you... did you say 'fall for?'"
<br><br>
My cardio implant began to beat more and more quickly. My face flushed. Had I been wrong? Could this body of bolts, wires, and plastic really contain whatever is left of the real Jason Cadalez? If his father was able to design a synthetic heart for me, maybe he could do the same for his son's brain. The question is... why?

## Sayonara Station, by Luke Steelman
{: .notice--cyberpunk-cyan}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-grey"> 
Wait a second, before we start - have you wondered how this book ended up in your hands? Where it came from, who delivered it?
<br><br>
Of course you haven't - nobody ever wonders about things like that. It's a shame, because the answer's quite interesting. I'd go as far to say it's fucking fascinating.
<br><br>
Not so long ago, most shipments were made via sea on freighters. Cheap, quick and (relatively) safe. But during the Fourth Corporate War, some genius in Arasaka had an idea - to release automated, self-replicating mines controlled by an AI into the ocean. What could possibly go wrong? A lot, it turns out.
<br><br>
The AI had a single objective: "Destroy enemy vessels." Simple, right? NUSA/Militech ships would get blown out of the water, while the Arasaka/Free State ships would sail by untouched. Except for the AI's iron-clad logic - since there was a non-zero probability that a vessel waving a friendly flag might also have enemies on board, in the interest of optimization it would also be sunk. Of course, when the leadheads back at Arasaka HQ realized what they'd done, they rushed to update the software - only for the AI to reject it as a virus. And thus, because of a handful of individuals' complete lack of imagination and foresight, the history of maritime travel came to an end.
<br><br>
So let's come back to the question - how did you end up with this book? Unless you live in Chicago, where it was published, then surely not via the Net - since that was destroyed by Bartmoss. Maybe it was shipped by plane? But air freight is incredibly expensive, so most likely not. By car then? We can't rule it out. But if I had to bet on it, I'd say it came to your city via train.
<br><br>
Imagine that trains (that's right, the ones that go choo! choo!) have survived into the present-day? Just last year, 15,526 miles of new train tracks were put into use, including the underground tunnel connecting Tokyo with Shanghai. At top-speed, an armored train can complete the distance between the two cities in under five hours! Now that's something I had to experience for myself. Two days later I was in Tokyo, standing on the platform of Sayonara Station...

## In the Shade of an Apple Tree, by Virginia Granchester
{: .notice--cyberpunk-cyan}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-grey"> 
My first memory isn't an image or a sound, but a smell. The smell of rotting apples - intense and dizzyingly sweet. I must've been around four. We were spending the summer at my grandparents' house. They had a small orchard with this old, huge apple tree by the fence. That year it grew so many apples that nobody even bothered to pick them. We just watched them fall to the ground, where they lay rotting.
<br><br>
It's hard to imagine now - a world where things used to grow out of the ground without our help, without bioengineering. Where an apple was something normal - a fruit whose shape and taste every child knew by instinct.
Where a normal person, like my granddad, could have more than he needed.
<br><br>
Sometimes I think back to that orchard and that sweet, drowsy smell. But all I taste is bitterness.

## The Chronicles of Titania: Book 1
{: .notice--cyberpunk-cyan}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-grey"> 
"You haven't an idea what you're talking about," the green-haired woman snorted and mockingly smiled. "I've visited many worlds, each built on a lie. All. Although... this might be the first time I've seen its people so stubbornly close their eyes to it."
<br><br>
Visan felt a rage swell inside of him. "How dare this woman, an outsider to the utopia of Titania, so harshly criticize a system that has guaranteed the happiness of millions?" he thought to himself. "If anyone is blind here, it's you!," Visan finally erupted. "Titania knows no inequity, no scarcity! For the first time in human history, everyone belongs to the privileged class!"<br>
The woman smiled softly with a mischievous twinkle in her amber eyes. "Is that so?" she asked. "And your work at this... cannery? Why are you unhappy there?"
<br><br>
Visan forced himself to remain calm and, in truth, he wasn't sure why the stranger's comments had made him so upset. Perhaps it wasn't the foreigner's fault she could not comprehend that humankind finally achieved the ideal society. Her home, as she described it, resembled a primitive world, one long tainted by the stain of feudalism. In a sense, she was like a child. Intelligent, yes, but ignorant and self-righteous to a fault.
<br><br>
"There must be a group within society responsible for this type of work," Visan explained. "Thankfully, due to the advancement of robotics, the means of production have become fully automized and shifted away from our hands. We now serve only in supervisory roles. So to answer your question, no, I'm not unhappy. The robots do my work for me. Wait... you do know what robots are, right?"
<br><br>
"Of course, I do. We have something similar, only made from clay and stone," the lime-haired woman replied, still with a smug tone in her voice. "Very well, your world has done away with work done by hand. But if that is the case... does that not mean workers such as yourself have lost their former value? Are you suggesting there are none who govern your progress from above your standing, who determine your responsibilities?"
<br><br>
No response. The woman's golden eyes flashed as she laughed at Visan's confused, flustered silence. "My apologies," the stranger's lips curled into an embarrassed smile. "Maybe you are an 'equal' member of this corpo...corporation...? But, of what I've seen here... nothing about it matches what you have described."

## Sex and Chrome
{: .notice--cyberpunk-cyan}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-grey">
Waves of pleasure cascade over my body, filling every pore of my being like ocean water through hot sand. More... I want more! How long I waited to feel his breath on my neck, his hands wrapped around my waist, his fingers caressing my lips. Our bodies are entwined in a primal dance, moving faster and faster to the rhythm of the creaking bed-springs, our skin bathed in flickers of neon. I can't hear myself moaning, but I must be since my throat is dry. I can't feel what my hands are doing, but the blood under my fingernails means I'm digging into his back. He's no longer kissing me, but nibbling, biting, pulling himself toward me harder, his control over me untamed, animalistic. It's so hot in the room that even his chrome is overheating, the bedsheets clinging to our sweat-soaked bodies...
</div>

## Crimeblock
{: .notice--cyberpunk-cyan}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-grey"> 
McCrane scanned the room with a deft Kiroshi sweep. This corpse was no different than the dozens he'd seen over the years. The dead man's eyes frozen in fear, his ligaments, wires and intestines strewn about the floor - none of it made any impact on McCrane anymore.
<br><br>
"I've lived too long," he thought. "And cops who don't die quick usually find themselves playing for the other side eventually."
<br><br>
"This case is as clear as a used napkin at Deputy Zhao's," he murmured to Junior Inspector Malinowski. "Cyberpsycho. Came in through the window. Victim let him inside, must've known each other. Prints are all over the glass."
<br><br>
"Holy shit..." Malinowski shook his head in disbelief. "How'd the fucker get all the way up to the eleventh floor?"
<br><br>
"See those grooves on the windowsill? Climbing spikes, implants kids these days are gettin' installed to pull stupid rooftop stunts, get cheap thrills..."
<br><br>
Malinowski made his way over to the window to examine the evidence his superior had so effortlessly pieced together. The veteran detective lit a cigarette and stared back into the corpse's lifeless eyes. Although McCrane had never seen this man before, he felt as if he had known him a long time. And still... he felt nothing for him. No pity, no compassion. This was only a body now, no longer a person.
<br><br>
Suddenly, Malinowski's unsteady voice woke McCrane from his thoughts. "Uh... boss? These prints on the outside of the window...? They... they belong to you."
<br><br>
McCrane let out a quick, punctuating chuckle. "Never much took you for a jokester, Malinowski," the detective said with an amused smirk as he rolled up his sleeves to expose his wrists. "And I wonder... just how would I get there without any climber's claws, hm?"
<br><br>
But before the junior inspector could respond, McCrane felt an uneasiness shoot up his spine. This room, this man, the smell of his blood... He felt compelled to walk over to the savaged victim and reach inside his pocket. A photo. His own face staring back at him.
<br><br>
Malinowski slowly drew his pistol. "I believed in you," the shaken protégé uttered with a pain in his voice. "All this time... I idolized a-a murderer."
<br><br>
"I... I don't understand," muttered McCrane, scarcely loud enough to hear his own voice. Something else began to drown out his words, even his thoughts - a strange, primal force. "For the first time in my life... I don't understand."
<br><br>
And then-CRACK-a gunshot.
</div>

## Chrome Night Love
{: .notice--cyberpunk-cyan}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-grey"> 
Chroman's mask glinted in the light of the setting sun, like a beacon in the dark of this rotten city. Lucille's heartbeat began to quicken. Her legs trembled beneath her, hot blood pumped through her veins in a way she didn't know it could.
<br><br>
He looked at her, his strong, masculine figure towering over the bloodied corporate corpse, which just a moment ago had violently tried to defile Lucille's virtue.
<br><br>
"What's the matter with me?" her mind raced. "Why him? Why me?" Hundreds of questions burned inside her brain. But, when she finally parted her lips to speak, only one question emerged: "Who are you really?"
<br><br>
Chroman took Lucille into his cold, metal hands. She flinched at the touch. "You know I can't tell you that. They'll find you, they'll rip my secret out of you any way they can... and then kill you.
<br><br>
"I--I don't care about any of that! I love you... I love you!"
<br><br>
She couldn't feel his face, his real one, concealed under that veil of chrome, but she could have sworn she could hear a note of emotion in his deep voice.
<br><br>
"You love a dream. You don't know who hides under this mask."
<br><br>
"I don't care what you look like."
<br><br>
"What if I'm disfigured?"
<br><br>
"I'll pay for the operation."
<br><br>
"And if I'm an android?"
<br><br>
"It doesn't matter!"
<br><br>
"And if..." Then, suddenly, in one swift motion, Chroman removed the mask to reveal... the face of Damita de la Veli! "... if I'm a woman?"
<br><br>
Lucille stood there, dumbstruck. A tempest of emotion swirled in a frenzy throughout her being. But after a moment passed, the storm calmed and she smiled warmly, taking her savior's face into her hands. The proverbial clouds of her tumultuous mind began to part. Lucille was beginning to see clearly at last. "How many times does a woman need to say she loves you," Lucille smirked and whispered softly, "before you believe her?"

## The Green Death
{: .notice--cyberpunk-cyan}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-grey"> 
The weathered man peered into the eyes of the young nomad as if trying to divine his thoughts. "Don't misunderstand," he said. "I don't mind unexpected guests. But you must recognize, when a man lives alone in the middle of the desert, he has a right to ask uncomfortable questions."
<br><br>
The boy wouldn't make eye contact, instead glancing nervously through the window, as if expecting to spot an armada of battle drones coursing straight for him across the night ski. "I... I'm running away," he muttered after a moment of hesitation. "From Green Phantom. He's been followin' me since Yellow Creek."
<br><br>
The old man didn't move a muscle save for a twitch at the corner of his mouth, revealing he knew more than he cared to admit. "You have nothing to fear, " he said softly. "The Green Phantom only comes for the worst criminals. If you hold regret in your heart, he'll forgive you. He'll offer a second chance."
<br><br>
The boy's anxious demeanor suddenly turned to a rebellious grin. "I regret nothing. And you, old man... You don't have the faintest clue what you're prattling on about."
<br><br>
"You're wrong. I've also met the Phantom once before."
<br><br>
The tenderfoot nomad's eyes widened in surprise for a brief moment. It seemed as if there was a question at the tip of his lips, but he refused to ask it.
<br><br>
"It's late," the old-timer said, "You should sleep. You're exhausted and need to gather strength before you continue running, if that's what you choose to do. My home is open to you for the night."
<br><br>
The boy uttered no thanks. Without a word, he stood and entered the small, dark bedroom where his host had prepared a bed. To find his way, he switched on his infrared, then immediately froze in place... There was a body lying in the bed. He edged closer until he could discern its shapes. A pool of cooling blood, withered hands contorted into unnatural angles... the vacant, dead eyes of the old man he had only just been talking to in the other room.
<br><br>
Suddenly, the walls began to emanate an otherworldly olive glow. The boy could sense a figure enter the bedroom and stand behind him. "If you regret nothing," hissed a cold, emotionless voice, "then why do you flee?"
<br><br>
Then black. The world of the young nomad plunged into darkness.
