I heard you came into some quality equipment recently and plan to keep it for yourself. I respect you, Lucious - a man needs ambition. But you're out of your element here. This equipment is hot and if you don't get it off your hands quicky... you'll get burned. I can offer a fair price for both sides and I can guarantee discretion. Think carefully.

It's all very simple. You'll get the number of the company transport which will already have the cooked papers inside. I sign off on the LOA (Lost on Arrival). Whenever customs officers see that LOA they know not to ask questions. And when company reps see the LOA, they ask far fewer than usual.

<span class="cyberpunk-cyan">
<hr class="cyberpunk-hr">
Militech's patented cDNA security system for Business and Premium class clients: cDNA encryption technology involves creating a unique client key based on user DNA and cyberware configuration (both hardware and software). Taking advantage of this method first requires installation of the Militech cDNA chip. The user's code is created at the time of chip authorization and is stored in a quantum state, making theft or interception nearly impossible. Should authorization fail, the code is immediately disintegrated. Militech ensures that it will not store clients' DNA and cyberware configuration data.

Mark, I still have a problem with the direction of this ad. It won't pass the focus groups with flying colors - if at all. What do we hope to achieve by advertising "milk?" I know you've seen the latest reports - even if we jack up nutrient content and tweak the consistency, we'll still lose to Biotechnica's alternatives. Our paste products already test worse with younger consumers.<br> 
Besides, it's not even clear who the target audience is for this. You ARE aware most of our target sales are in urban markets, right? Unless you're playing off a sense of misplaced nostalgia or some reference I just don't get.<br> 
We need to seriously consider reassigning the marketing budget from "milk" to something else. Do you have anything in mind from R&D that's already been tested?

Lindsay,<br>
I'm not fully prepared to drop the milk project just yet - despite your first impressions, we've actually put quite a lot of thought into this campaign. Still, I'm willing to explore other options. We have the meat mixture based on insect proteins ready to go (the same we discussed last year but weren't happy with texture or smell). There's also a soluble powder based on mealworm larvae used as the base for porridges and soups - main problem there is we'd have to start from scratch. Let me know if either of these options speaks to you and we'll sync on the topic later this week.

Notes after presentation:<br>
- settled on the name "Orgiatic" - tested very well, mktg and PR are in favor<br> 
- have time til year end to nail down full product line flavor enhancement isn't enough, mktg suggests adding substance that allows us to brand it as "wholesome" mktg decision is focus on "premium" snack food, draw associations with movement ,energy, modernity artificial supplements? flavored based on mealworm larva - have fixed assets for it, low cost (but check with legal if we can list core nutrients w/o printing source)

<span class="cyberpunk-cyan">
<hr class="cyberpunk-hr">
Orgiatic will be All Foods' flagship, "wholesome" vitamin booster with accelerated absorption moving foward.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, we had to forgo using mealworm-derived powder as the paste base because production rhythm would not match with marketing assumptions. Even were that not true, we would prefer to avoid mutual cannibalization (both sales and public perception) between Orgiatic and other All Foods brands which already use mealworm larvae as the fundamental ingredient. Despite unforeseen obstacles, we continue to aim for at least 300% of daily vitamin needs, although exceeding this mark would most benefit the brand in terms of maintaining positive PR and increasing All Foods' market share in vitamin products.

RE: Relic
<br><br>
Mr. Cheever, if you were an economist, I would tell you that the game played between the largest corporations has ceased to be a zero sum game - I am simply trying to restore the natural order of things. Yet, since you are not an economist, only a mere representative, my answer would be that I am doing this out of civic duty... But perhaps this would imply that I underestimate your intelligence. 
<br><br>
You ask why Johnny Silverhand? It is a long story. Come to Konpeki Plaza and the veil of mystery shall be lifted.
