<span class="cyberpunk-violet pen-bold">Club attacked</span>
<span class="cyberpunk-cyan">
<hr class="cyberpunk-hr">
On Wednesday at approx. 1:50 AM a netrunner attack took place in booth 11. The witness was Thomas Briggs, who was in a session with a doll jacked into the system. As a result of the attack, he went into shock and presented psychosomatic symptoms.<br>
It was found that the netrunner attack induced a psychotic episode in the doll. In anticipation of a possible all-out assault on Clouds, at 2:06 AM all of Cloud's security were requested on the premises, and 10 minutes later Tyger Claws reinforcements were called.<br>
Luckily, booth 11 was the netrunner's sole target.<br>
Mr. Briggs received first aid and was transferred to a psychiatric clinic. As of today (Friday) the doll is not suitable for use.

One more shitshow like with Evelyn Parker and you can kiss your job goodbye. Hiromi's words.<br>
So far we've put up with your crude behavior toward employees and turned a blind eye when you beat up a client. But this? This was beyond the pale.
