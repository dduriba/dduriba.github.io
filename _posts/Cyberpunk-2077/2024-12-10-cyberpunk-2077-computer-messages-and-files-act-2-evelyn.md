<span class="cyberpunk-violet pen-bold">Club attacked</span>
<span class="cyberpunk-cyan">
<hr class="cyberpunk-hr">
On Wednesday at approx. 1:50 AM a netrunner attack took place in booth 11. The witness was Thomas Briggs, who was in a session with a doll jacked into the system. As a result of the attack, he went into shock and presented psychosomatic symptoms.<br>
It was found that the netrunner attack induced a psychotic episode in the doll. In anticipation of a possible all-out assault on Clouds, at 2:06 AM all of Cloud's security were requested on the premises, and 10 minutes later Tyger Claws reinforcements were called.<br>
Luckily, booth 11 was the netrunner's sole target.<br>
Mr. Briggs received first aid and was transferred to a psychiatric clinic. As of today (Friday) the doll is not suitable for use.

OK, I got a little distracted from actual sales, but hear me out - I have a fucking good excuse.<br>
Next week we could be make twice - no, TRIPLE our target! I specced this guy from Jig-Jig Street on the Pleasures of NC site. He's not the usual street hawker, doesn't have the gift of the gab, but all it takes is a few words and he knows exactly the kind of person he's doing biz with and what they're after.

If you think you fool me with this "I'm actually working" bullshit when really you just surf porn sites and hang out with lowlifes instead of making SALES - then you're only fooling yourself.<br>
Next week you're making DOUBLE the target, and I make up whatever is missing with implants I rip out of your myself. Clear?

No need for that, I already met the guy, gave him a few of our BDs as a trial run and before I even got back to the studio he called asking if we have more. Trust me - he knows what peeps like and what sells.<br>
He's not the "How can I help you?" customer service type, but I never saw anyone leave empty handed. Customers'll be drawn to the DH Moth brand like our BD stars are to the light at the end of the tunnel.

<span class="cyberpunk-cyan">
<hr class="cyberpunk-hr">
1. Actor stripped of implants alive, amputated at the joints, removal of internal organs, hemorrhaging
<br><br>
2. Actress placed on a stage in front of spectators (extras), must perform despite complete lack of talent. The crowd whistles, laughs, shouts names, then throws bottles. At the end they tear her to shreds.
<br><br>
3. Actor wakes up with his hand pinned down by something heavy. He has to free himself (client will pay extra if he ends up cutting/tearing hand off).
<br><br>
4. Actress escaping from somewhere she was held captive. She manages to get out of the building and into a car before she's caught. (Note: the girl's clever, we have to really convince her that she stands a chance.)
<br><br>
5. Actress wants to commit suicide, we use that. Let her jump out the window. String up a net first without her noticing. Same drill - make her think she stands a chance.

That chick is a bad omen - that's all I'll say. We should get rid of her ASAP and forget scrolling any BDs with her, becauase if word about her spreads we're fucked.

I don't believe you're shitting your pants just because of some comatose girl. What are you on, hm? You know what - don't answer that. Whatever it is, just stop taking it before your brain damage gets even worse.

Cuz like, you can tell she's not from Jig-Jig! More like Clouds or even the Mox. And for the record, I don't touch our supply and you know that. But there's this corpo - I sold him some of our shit. Apparently it made him aggressive - smacked some joytoy across the face. He told me when it happened he noticed the shadow of Lizzie on the wall, the girl who started the Mox, and guess what happened? A week later he was dead. They found him in some backalley, tied to a gutter, suffocated with a stocking. It's not like I was choom with the guy, but still... that's no way to go!

Who cares how you "go" if you're DEAD?<br>
Decapitated with a nail filer or shot in the spleen - it makes not one iota of difference.<br>
If it's not the RPM then it's the BDs that are fucking with your head, because your imagination is starting to get more whack than what we're scrolling.

He's a corpo. He said his job isn't that different to mine because he also has to put on an act all day. Like, he has to play golf with his boss, who he hatesor whatever. He seemed kinds nice.
