## Cyberpunk 2020 Rulebook
{: .notice--cyberpunk-cyan}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-grey">
<span class="cyberpunk-lightgreen" style="display: inline-block; margin-bottom: 8px;">The Pickup - Can be found in the room next to Royce office.<br>
The Heisenberg Principle - Can be found on a table in the basement of the building on Rovinj street in Little China, Watson.</span><br>
It doesn't matter how well you do something, as long as you look good doing it. If you're going to blow it, make sure you look like you planned it that way.<br>
Normally, clothes and looks don't matter in an adventure - in this world, having a leather armor jacket and mirrorshades is a serious consideration.<br>
Think dangerous; be dangerous. Think weak; be weak.<br>
Never walk into a room when you can stride in.<br>
Never drive slow when you can drive fast.<br>
Throw yourself up against danger and take it head on.<br>
Never play it too safe.<br>
Stay committed to the Edge.<br>

## Diary (117-121/77)
{: .notice--cyberpunk-cyan}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-grey">
<span class="cyberpunk-lightgreen" style="display: inline-block; margin-bottom: 8px;">Can only be found inside the AV atop Konpeki Plaza, in which Saburo Arasaka arrives during The Heist.<br>
Decrypted Shard.</span><br>
117/77<br> 
We have set sail. Only Hanako knows the true purpose of our visit to Night City. The question is what to do with A. Hellman. He has proven loyal beyond even my own expectations and deserves compensation. Perhaps he might be interested in the position of Director of the Kyoto Institute of Technology, sweeten the deal by letting him have his own handpicked team. Employees like him should be kept on a short leash without seeing it as such.
<br><br>
118/77<br>
Militech have outdone themselves. This is not just a port, but a fortress. But the atoll is of no interest to me - it is what lies in the depths. I know what they hide. We should pay a tribute - five shots for every one of ours that lies on the seabed. The only thing that restrains me from giving the order is mercy for the innocents working on the port - I will spare them the panic and anguish with our missiles.<br> 
So rest well, Ye Fallen. Ne'er again will Ye be awoken with a BANG!
<br><br>
119/77<br> 
The further I am from home, the more my memories become sharpened, more acute. 
The faces of old enemies are suddenly thrown into relief. Even J.S. - I almost completely forgot about him.
<br><br>
120/77<br> 
Hanako thinks that she should be the one to have a word with Y, or at the very least accompany me. I declined. She took it in her usual dignified manner. Still, she asked what I intend to do. As of yet I have no answer to this question.
<br><br>
121/77<br> 
I see the coastline. Strange - in my memories the city seemed larger. If I wanted to, i could wipe it off the map in under ten minutes. I shared this thought with Hanako - she thinks I shouldn't do that. I usually defer to her opinion. But if the Relic somehow fell into the wrong hands, maybe it would be better to bury it among the ashes of NC? 
Until we talk to Y, I will hold off on a firm decision.
