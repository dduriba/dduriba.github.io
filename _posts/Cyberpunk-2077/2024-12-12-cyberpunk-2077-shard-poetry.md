# The Fall of Etemenanki

The Fall of Etemenanki<br> 
(manuscript found behind the Totentanz)
<br><br>
All ye mighty<br> 
look and despair<br> 
for here lived the City
<br><br>
in the far-off land of Shinear<br> 
where once was clay tamed and wrought
<br><br>
to build a temple among the narrow streets<br> 
where the howl of crazed prophets rose<br> 
from their skiff and the shadow of the ziggurat fell across the sands
<br><br>
Look and despair for here rose the Tower<br> 
strong as a tongue glazed in spit<br> 
held fast on the scaffolding of throats on the vocal cords
<br><br>
up which were pulled buckets of mortar<br> 
prayers fragments of code late cuneiform<br> 
on tablets plated with copper encrusted with tin
<br><br>
look and remember for here She fell and Her name was Babel<br>
[o Babel of dreams!] lest we be scattered over the face of the earth<br> 
ask the archeologists beyond the Totentanz
<br><br>
how she crumbled to dust the soft down of dialect<br> 
how the desert tore her how the sands of time ground her<br> 
until the word was ground fine and scattered among us
<br><br>
look and beware in the final hours of night<br> 
for the sun shall rise over the ruins and dawn shall once again melt<br> 
from the rubble the memory of the City its original source

# America: A Prophecy
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
The Terror answerd: I am Orc, wreath'd round the accursed tree: <br>
The times are ended; shadows pass, the morning gins to break; <br>
the fiery joy, that Urizen perverted to ten commands, <br>
What night he led the starry hosts thro' the wide wilderness, <br>
That stony law I stamp to dust; and scatter religion abroad <br>
To the four winds as a torn book, and none shall gather the leaves; <br>
But they shall rot on desert sands, and consume in bottomless deeps, <br>
To make the deserts blossom, and the deeps shrink to their fountains, <br>
And to renew the fiery joy, and burst the stony roof; <br>
That pale religious lechery, seeking Virginity, <br>
May find it in a harlot, and in coarse-clad honesty <br>
The undefil'd, tho' ravish'd in her cradle night and morn; <br>
For everything that lives is holy, life delights in life; <br>
Because the soul of sweet delight can never be defil'd. <br>
Fires enwrap the earthly globe, yet Man is not consum'd; <br>
Amidst the lustful fires he walks; his feet become like brass, <br>
His knees and thighs like silver, and his breast and head like gold.
