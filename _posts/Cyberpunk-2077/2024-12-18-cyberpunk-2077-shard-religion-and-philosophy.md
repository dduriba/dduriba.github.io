## The World as Will and Idea

[...]But, besides all this, death is the great opportunity no longer to be I;â€”to him who uses it. During life the will of man is without freedom: his action takes place with necessity upon the basis of his unalterable character in the chain of motives. But every one remembers much that he has done, and on account of which he is by no means satisfied with himself. If now he were to go on living, he would go on acting in the same way, on account of the unalterable nature of his character. Accordingly he must cease to be what he is in order to be able to arise out of the germ of his nature as a new and different being. Therefore death looses these bonds; the will again becomes free; for freedom lies in the Esse, not in the Operari[...]

## Beelzebub's Tales to His Grandson

Even before our arrival, many beings in Babylon had lost their minds over this subject, while many others were inching closer to the same fate. The "burning question" of the day, the question that wracked the brains of both "pitiful scientists" and normal beings of Babylon was this:"Do we have a soul or not?" There were all sorts of the most fantastic theories on this subject, with new ones appearing all the time, and each and every one of the "tempting hypotheses" had its supporters. Despite the overwhelming number and diversity of these beliefs, they were all based on one of two completely opposing premises. The first was called "atheism," while the other was "idealism" or "dualism." All duelistic hypothesis held the soul existed and, of course, that it was immortal and could suffer many things even after the death of the being. Meanwhile, the atheistic theories held the complete opposite view. In short, my boy, when we cam to Babylon, we came upon what could only be called "constructing the Tower of Babel."

## Homo Deus: Christianity and Cybermodification

"So God created man in his own image, in the image of God." So says the Book of Genesis. Religious components of cybernetic body modification believe the Christian God intended the same perfection for man as He Himself possesses. Suffering, disease, death - these exist in contradiction with divinity, but can be overcome with the aid of science and technology. So called "cybertheologists" interpret God's command to "subdue the earth" quite literally. By their account, any and all means that might enable man to reach a state closer to divinity are "good", both ethically and morally.

However, some in their Christian fold have voiced concern that such cybertheologists guilty of excessive hubris. For an immortal man would this become his own savior, rendering the existence of the one, true ascendant God superfluous. Only the soul should be immortal, while the human body - as a "temple of the Holy Spirit" - should be accepted as it is: mortal and destined for resurrection on Judgment Day.

"Eritis sicut dii," said the serpent to Eve: "You will be as Gods." Religious purists exhort their sisters and brothers in faith to resist this temptation of Satan, masked as the will of God. But cybertheologists have stood fast and supplemented their cause with the phrase "scientes bonum et malum". They call upon humanity to tap into the divine and cosciously interpret for themselves what is Good and what is Evil.
