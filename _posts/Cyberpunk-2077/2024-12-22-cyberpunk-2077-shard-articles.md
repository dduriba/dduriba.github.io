## Emergency on Demand
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-grey">
<hr class="cyberpunk-hr">
How did it happen? When and why did we as a society decide that human life is a commodity? A luxury?
<br><br>
My mother passed away at 45. She still had decades of life to live until it was all stolen from her by common pneumonia. If she had held even the cheapest Trauma Team policy, she could have been cured within an hour. But she couldn't afford it. My mother died five months before her scheduled appointment with our family practitioner...
<br><br>
The idea of privatized healthcare is deeply ingrained in our public psyche. Already in 2020, there was widespread consensus that 500 eurodollars a month was a fair price for Trauma Team insurance. Health wasn't something you were given, it was something you earned. The private system may not be perfect, but there's no alternative, we thought.
<br><br>
BULLSHIT.
<br><br>
Now cross the Pacific Ocean to the USSR where they also have highly trained medical technicians, high-precision nanosurgical suites, specialized antibodies, intravenous probes, the list goes on. Emergency airlifts using modern AVs equipped with cryotonic chambers? They have those, too. The difference, then? They don't leave their people to die on the streets, at the store, in their homes. They don't force anyone to purchase their lives from a corporation as if they're the ones who own it.
<br><br>
Public healthcare isn't some unachievable utopia. It is a REALITY.
<br><br>
Trauma Team, on the other hand, treats its policyholders as both potential patients to be treated and potential products to be bought. They save lives only because there is profit in it. A saved life is a returning customer. Client death can also bring in fiscal gains in the form of organ and implant resale, though of course in regulated, smaller sums. An emergency care provider can't afford to give its managers reasons to deliberately kill off its clientele base for short-term windfalls.
<br><br>
Surely, you ask, these medical "professionals" are also guided by their Hippocratic Oaths?
<br><br>
Please...

## New Release Braindances
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-grey">
<hr class="cyberpunk-hr">
What's up, BD-maniacs? Hungry for a new emo-rush? Then check out the latest word from the freshest BDs on the market.
<br><br>
Foreign Body<br>
The body is everything. There is nothing else. It is you, but it is also just a tool for your mind to interact with the world. But what would happen if this tool tried to live its own life? What if it tried... to kill you?
Though not a particularly original addition to the thriller genre, this braindance featuring Luke Poller is still a solid experiential ride. The fear of disobedient implants has been around since pirates were walking around on peg legs – well, maybe not that long – as a result, the trope has been pervasive in film, braindance, and urban legend alike. Still, "Foreign Body" borrows some of the genre's best elements while still incorporating just enough new stuff to the mix to keep it interesting. After all, it's not every day you see the world from the perspective of a sentient arm.
<br><br>
Maxwell's Rehab<br>
This braindance season has been chock full of horror, but this one stands out from the rest. The always phenomenal Maxwell Ramirez is pushed to the brink of cyberpsychosis so we can relive his return to normalcy. The title offers a tone of optimism, but don't let that fool you. You will relive Maxwell's slip into psychosis, the heartbreak of his wife, and the gradual reintegration into a world that is now far different from how he left it. This BD is a must-relive of the season, but it's not for the faint of heart.
<br><br>
Badlands Raid<br>
At last, a BD for those looking for something a little lighter. "Badlands Raid" is a remake of the 2023 classic, which was an innovative tour de force of the time. For those of you unfamiliar, the plot revolves around an ordinary, boring guy who accidentally gets tangled up in a nomad ambush on a Zetatech convoy. I won't spoil it because, even though the main plot hasn't changed in 54 years, most people these days probably don't know the ending. What I will say is this: the remake's creators have introduced a few modern twists into the story that should make for a pleasant surprise to classics-lovers and newbies alike.

## The Relic – why all the fuss?
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-grey">
<hr class="cyberpunk-hr">
For years, experts in the field of cybernetics, neurology and psychology have been desperately trying to merge human consciousness with silicon. Until now, their efforts have been unsuccessful - though scientists have managed to create artificial intelligences that can compare, or indeed, surpass human intellect, copying the human "I" has remained beyond our capabilities. Attempts to do so have merely resulted in sophisticated chatbots - digital beings capable of mimicking human speech and mannerisms, but devoid of self-awareness.
<br><br>
Today, experts from Arasaka announced a breakthrough. Their newest project, dubbed the "Relic," allows human minds to be copied onto shards no larger than a credchip.
What's more, the shard can be slotted into one's neural port, allowing its user to "hear" and "see" digitized personality constructs.
<br><br>
Sadly, I haven't been able to personally examine the specifications of this remarkable piece of technology. Access to the Relic is heavily restricted by Arasaka, and only a small, select group of testers are allowed to participate in the program. Unsurprisingly, these testers are among the wealthiest and most influential people in the world - precisely the kinds of people Arasaka would like to have in its pocket. For the ordinary consumers reading this - don't expect the Relic to hit mass markets anytime soon.

<br><br>

## Healthcare and Traffic Safety – Trauma Team Leads the Way
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-grey">
<hr class="cyberpunk-hr">
Second-rate equipment, under-trained medical "professionals", and high death rates – this is the best Night City's public emergency services have to offer. In addition to poor performance metrics, so too has their public image suffered. Scandals involving city EMTs colluding with scavengers have gone from rare to commonplace.
<br><br>
Recent cuts in municipal healthcare spending have led to the outright collapse of a medical system that already underperformed by most standards in the developed world. Ironically, this so-called "reform" resulted in a greater drain of doctors, nurses, paramedics and dispatchers from the public sector. Where quality healthcare was spotty before, now too is even calling the emergency hotline. Should you be among the lucky to reach a dispatcher, expect more than a half hour for an ambulance to arrive. And should you not bleed out before reaching the hospital, you're even less likely to find an available bed. Recent data show a survival rate for traffic accidents in Night City at a meager 17%.
<br><br>
For comparison, the average survival rate for traffic accidents across all Trauma Team policies is 91%. Response time is guaranteed to never exceed 3 minutes. Heaven on Earth? No. The minimum we all deserve. Something to keep in mind as you plan your personal budget... Purchase Trauma Team's Platinum-level coverage for the cost of Gold and safeguard your life today. Limited-time offer.

## Left Jab: Boxer's Monthly

<hr class="cyberpunk-hr">
Kazuo Kano – ronin from Osaka
<br><br>
Kazuo Kano's name is on the lips of everyone in the boxing world. The up-and-coming light heavyweight remains undefeated after twenty professional fights, seventeen of which were won by technical knockout.<br>
Some accuse Kano of doping, others say he has connections with the Yakuza. While training in Night City, the light heavyweight was allegedly seen "receiving" guests from Japan in his gym. Afterwards they were then seen being carried out of the gym unconscious. Wide scars have been visible near Kano's ribs for the last three fights. Local ripperdocs say that the scars definitely do not look like an appendix removal procedure... 
Will Kano become the light heavyweight champion of the world? We'll see after Malone takes his revenge on Hernandez.

## The Mox
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-grey">
<hr class="cyberpunk-hr">
(...)It's one of those stories that is either very simple or very complicated, depending on who you ask. For Janice, it was a mix of both: "The Mox came to exist because it had to. We didn't have a soul in our corner, no one to make sure street justice was on our side. So we took matters into our own hands."
<br><br>
The Mox is composed of the people who, if any of them disappeared from the streets tomorrow, you might never even notice: sex workers, ennyless artists, aimless rebels, and restless souls who weren't dealt a fair hand. Today, the Mox is thriving, as demonstrated by the booming biz of Lizzie's Bar. Lizzie's is renown for being arguably the best braindance club in Night City. Corporate suits, gangoons, pop stars, and locals alike all gather at Lizzie's to kick back, have a drink, and dip into the most beautifully scrolled and tuned BDs you've ever experienced. Most customers, however, are oblivious to the fact that the club is gang owned and operated, that the Mox are in charge, watching after their own. Just like the Lizzie of legend once did.
<br><br>
Know the story? "Lizzied used to work here back when it was just a typical dive with a stripper pole," Janice proudly explained. "She took care of the girls, made sure eddies were falling into the pockets... and their teeth weren't falling to the curb. Like this one time, this fucker (Editor's note: referring to a Tyger Claws gang member) was having too much "fun" with one of the girls, and Lizzie just couldn't stomach it anymore. Story is she deprived the worm of his little Tyger balls so quick and nasty it took them two days to clean up all the blood and puke splatter. 'Course, the Claws found out fast and they flatlined her in a flash. But everyone that she had impacted in some way, they were still around. They came together, fought back and-- (pause) Well... you already know the rest."

## NC Night Life – Drinks, Dancing, Debauchery
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-grey">
<hr class="cyberpunk-hr">
(...) If you're a dancehead like us, don't miss out on LIZZIE'S. You'll find no better braindance club in the city, no matter how deep you dig. Modern boxes, solid tech, but most important: the catalogue, chock-full of nearly any exp you can imagine. You'll find everything you need to get you off - fast or slow, nasty or classy, and everything in-between. Don't let the girls at the front door scare you off or kill your buzz - they're wary of newcomers, but once you get in they'll treat you like one of their own. Trust us, give LIZZIE'S a try and you'll never go anywhere else. 
<br><br>
Now, THE AFTERLIFE? That's a different story. Sure, you can cut loose and have a good time here, but THE AFTERLIFE is a place of business above all else. Want to meet with a fixer about a job that needs doing? Discuss important gig details with a client over drinks? Or maybe just sit back and people watch, to see the comings and goings of the NC underworld's biggest merc and fixer names? THE AFTERLIFE is a great place for all of the above. The only place, really. 
<br><br>
If you're looking for the city's marquee events, you'll find yourself at RIOT. Chart-topping playlists, live performances from the brightest stars (both local and from around the world), DJ battles, unique music shows, and media-packed album premieres - sound like your scene? Don't miss out on RIOT. (...)

## How to keep your shards and data safe from picksockets! [TOP 3 WAYS]
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-grey">
<hr class="cyberpunk-hr">
Are you reading this on the street? In a store? In the metro? When was the last time you checked your neural sockets?
<br><br>
The picksocket plague is worse than it's ever been. The NCPD received hundreds of complaints in their last cycle from residents who reported having shards stolen from their neural sockets. How can you protect yourself? We've got you covered!
<br><br>
Thefts largely go uninvestigated due to the police's prioritization of violent crime, which has left picksockets feeling increasingly bold. Exploits used to hack our neuralware are widely available on the black market, so many thieves have shifted focus from our pockets to our sockets. One brief moment of inattention and your private information is flying from your neck into someone's sticky fingers. The NCPD admits tracking such thieves is difficult and a waste of resources, which is why we're here to help keep your info safe with 3 options to suit any budget.
<br><br>
1. Change your settings to ensure you receive notifications any time a shard is removed from a neural port. Unfortunately, this approach leads to a high number of false positives when you're fiddling with your own neuralware.<br>
2. Invest in new sockets. Several new models on the market already have built-in safety and authorization measures to keep shards locked in tight. But if you're pinching every enny, this solution could break the bank.<br>
3. Duct tape. Slap on a square of that and those shards aren't going anywhere. On a budget? Bad with tech? No regard for style? Then this is the option for you!

## A Family of Empire
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-grey">
<hr class="cyberpunk-hr">
The legacy of Arasaka needs no introduction. The Arasaka Corporation is one of the world's most powerful, with offices located in every major metropolis across the globe. For years, it has been behind the proverbial wheel of our planet's economy and society. The history of Arasaka in Night City is deserving of its own article, but suffice to say, the media industry in our city follows the family behind the megacorp as closely as they do share prices.
<br><br>
The story of the Arasaka family is one of empire – a true dynasty under the rule of patriarch Saburo Arasaka. Rumors of the great Saburo's retirement and cession of company control (as well as of its closely guarded secrets) to his daughter, Hanako, and son, Yorinobu, have come and passed in recent years. But has the time come where such rumors may finally contain a grain of truth?
<br><br>
Our sources report that Yorinobu Arasaka is currently in Night City, but not for a social call. And yet, if Yorinobu is strategizing a move for the throne, what of Hanako? Experts who follow the family closely unanimously agree that – due to "ideological" differences between Saburo and Yorinobu – Hanako will likely cement herself as the one true heir to the immense fortune and power of the Arasaka family. However, reality is hardly ever so predictable. Familial power dynamics can shift in an instant. For example, what would happen if Hanako fell from favor at a time when Yorinobu had his father's ear? And what scenario might cause such a fall?
<br><br>
No family is without its secrets, and the Arasakas are no exception. After all... "What appears first as heaven, appears second as hell." – Japanese proverb.

## The vampire prince is back!
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-grey">
<hr class="cyberpunk-hr">
Monster hunters beware!
<br><br>
"Turbo Dracula" is a dark, gritty, visceral action game experience where you play as the plasma-thirsty prince of puncture wounds himself – Dracula! He has risen again, this time as a digi-clone in a body of chrome... but his appetite for blood hasn't waned one bit. Assisted by the descendants of an ancient bloodline, he wages war against the sinister HelsingCorp headed by the demon brothers Manchester. They aim to take over the world with the help of genetically spliced werewolf-zombies. Dracula must face difficult choices such as whether to resurrect his old friend Viago or to transmutate into his nemeses!
<br><br>
A polished real-time combat system and non-linear storyline offer the player deep immersion in singleplayer, while the multiplayer mode allows you to team up with your choombas as they take control of the brooding Varney or blonde fan favorite Herbert. Without spoiling any of the endings (yes, multiple endings!), I'll leave you with just one thing... Lady Carmilla Ruthven-Batory is hands down the most captivating character ever written in the hundred-year history of video games. Period.

## No Life 3 - Review
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-grey">
<hr class="cyberpunk-hr">
After fifty long years, the wait is finally over! The third and final installment of the No Life series will be available for purchase TOMORROW! As has been reported already, gamers should not expect any major shakeups in regard to the protagonist. We still play as strong-silent-type scientist Baron Freimensch. We follow Baron as he ventures to the Arctic Circle to... Well, why spoil it when you'll have your hands on it in less than 24 hours! The gist: with Alice at Baron's side and trusty crowbar in hand, those nasty aliens are in for a rude awakening.

## The Struggle of O'Neill Station.
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-grey">
<hr class="cyberpunk-hr">
The European Space Agency (ESA) started out with seemingly noble intentions: "We'll open the door to the universe." "The Solar System - a home to all." And so on an so forth.
<br><br>
It didn't take long for these catchphrases to reveal themselves for what they truly were - colonial ambitions wrapped up in lofty ideals. We, the builders and first inhabitants of O'Neill 1 have witnessed this first-hand. The ESA sent us into space with promises of a new life and a better tomorrow. Instead, what lay in wait for us was a complete lack of freedom and back-breaking work in extremely dangerous conditions.
<br><br>
We would've pulled through, we would've toughed it out for the greater good - if only they treated us as human beings, informed us of their decisions, listened to our concerns and requests... But the ESA ignored us.
<br><br>
The consequences were inevitable - in 2022, after completing construction of the station, our situation was critical. Station management demanded eighteen hours of work every day, seven days a week from everyone - regardless of age or health condition. Our peaceful protest was met with a disproportionate use of force, which included stun-guns. They thought it would break us, just like the countless protests they broke back on Earth.
<br><br>
The thing is, out here it's not so easy to call for reinforcements. Workers outnumbered guards 40:1, and one stun-gun charge held only fifteen rounds. The ESA's management had effectively shot themselves in the foot. It was over before they could realize - only seven hours passed before O'Neill 1 and O'Neill 2 declared independence and became the first nations established outside of Earth...

## Who is Lizzy Wizzy pretending to be?
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-grey">
<hr class="cyberpunk-hr">
"We are who we pretend to be. I've pretended to be everything - that's why I've found the truth."
<br><br>
Lizzy Wizzy is an artist par excellence. Her work includes award-winning albums and concert tours, film appearances as well as (for lack of a better term) conceptual performance art. Her latest artistic obsession features the medium of braindance. In recent interviews, Lizzy has mused about the boundary between our documentation of reality versus our active shaping of it. Could that mean Lizzy Wizzy plans to scroll her own BD? We can only dream! The chance to live just one day in her chrome skin... Fans would go wild!

## What Really Happened in Arasaka Tower?
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-grey">
<hr class="cyberpunk-hr">
[...] If Militech was behind the assault on Arasaka Tower in 2023, and if there's actual EVIDENCE to support that, then why didn't Arasaka return the favor and nuke Militech?
<br><br>
By now there's no doubt the bomb was manufactured by Militech, but that doesn't mean they detonated it. I confess, I'm not a huge fan of the popular theory that Johnny Silverhand, the controversial rockerboy, was behind the whole thing. In fact, I'm not really a Silverhand fan, period. Silverhand was a poser and a blowhard - not someone who would actually follow through on his grandiose bluffs (full disclosure, I just don't think Silverhand would have the balls to pull off something like that).
<br><br>
Let's think this through - who hates corporations the most?
<br><br>
Nomads, obviously. Remember that mass-market BD called "Badlands Raid" from the 20s about a band of nomads who attack a Militech convoy? Well, guess when it premiered? That's right - on the night of the attack. Coincidence? I think not.
<br><br>
Yes, yes, there's a Silverhand cameo in there somewhere, but that's just a marketing ploy - a BD scrolled by a bunch of cactus-huggers wouldn't sell for an enny without a recognizable face. But I'm more intrigued by the main actress - how is it she didn't star in any other production despite "Badlands Raid's" huge sales? Where was she during the attack?

## Arasaka and Ornithology: Three Japanese Words to Know
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-grey">
<hr class="cyberpunk-hr">
As conversations over factionalism within Arasaka heat up, many industry insiders wonder about the company's future trajectory. If you struggle to understand the complicated inner machinations of the world's largest arms manufacturer, look no further than the obscure science of ornithology. Yes, that's right; the study of birds can help. At least, in a sense. There are three Japanese words every corporate player ought to be familiar with: kiji, hato, and taka.
<br><br>
Kiji - green pheasant. This bird has long held cultural and symbolic significance in Japan. One can admire the world's last living specimens at Hanako Arasaka's private preserve on the island of Shikoku. But the word "kiji" also bears meaning among the factional identities within Arasaka. This group, with Hanako at its center, consists primarily of conservative technocrats who wish to follow the course set by Saburo Arasaka himself.
In his daughter, Hanako, they see a guiding force to maintain the old order and stability within the corporation..
<br><br>
Hato - dove. The symbolism of the dove is recognized far and wide. The symbol also aptly captures the character of the a much smaller faction within the company led by Michiko Arasaka, daughter of the late Kei and niece to Hanako.* This liberal wing of the corporation has unified those who seek deeper reforms. Although they currently hold little influence, they enjoy growing support popularity among some politicians and media personalities.
<br><br>
Taka - hawk. As symbolic as the dove is, so, too, is the hawk. This faction, headed by Yorinobu Arasaka, often prefers to take the most direct and uncompromising solutions. Both stubborn and temperamental, he resembles Saburo which has given him wide support among the more militant-minded Arasaka Corp. elite. However, his more pro-Western inclinations and ideas that are innovative as they are controversial have weakened his support from the Board's loyal traditionalists.
<br><br>

## Storm on the Mare Crisium
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-grey">
<hr class="cyberpunk-hr">
By now we're all avid viewers of the reality TV show that is orbital politics. 
Except this is real life, and what happens up there could have real consequences for all of us down here. Recently everyone's been talking about the attack on Ursula Correira, resulting in the complete loss of control in the lower half of her body. The media has been endlessly replaying remarks made by Correira's younger brother, Vagner, while also discussing the latest outfit worn by Yara Ayoade to the official press conference where she denied rumors that Correira's family had any hand in her "accident."
<br><br>
I don't know about all of you, but with each passing day, the saying "What happens in orbit, stays in orbit" is starting to sound like dangerously wishful thinking.

## The Last Rockerboy: The Solo Career of Kerry Eurodyne
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-grey">
<hr class="cyberpunk-hr">
The friendship between Johnny Silverhand and Kerry Eurodyne as well as the trauma behind Johnny's mysterious disappearance have contributed to the cloak of misinformation that has obscured the true story of Samurai for years. The stubbornly loyal Eurodyne always kept silent about the foundational leadership role he held in the cult band. To the detriment of his own career, he paid full tribute to Silverhand, granting him full authorship over the band's songs.
<br><br>
Following Samurai's disintegration and a personal retreat to the Philippines where Kerry rediscovered his creative roots, Eurodyne cut ties from the past and began the next chapter of his legacy. Today, it has become clear beyond doubt that his own successes not only match those of Samurai's, but have repeatedly surpassed them. Kerry's effortless, natural charisma and strong stage presence electrify crowds without fail. By comparison, Silverhand's fiery shouts and political grandstanding appear now as nothing more than ordinary attention grabbing designed to mask the otherwise pedestrian quality of his musical talent.
