## The Unification War... for Gonks!
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-grey">
<hr class="cyberpunk-hr">
*The Unification War is the most recent armed conflict to take place in North America since the Collapse, lasting from January 2069 to June 2070.
<br><br>
*Although the Unification War is formally recognized as a war between the New United States of America (NUSA) and the governments of the Free States, most scholars also classify the conflict as a corporate war. It is well known that the NUSA was backed by Militech hardware, personnel and other resources, whereas the Free States received the significant yet tacit support of the Arasaka Corporation.
<br><br>
*The Unification War is also sometimes referred to as the Metal War or Metal Wars, in reference to the wide use of armored cavalry units (so-called "panzers").
<br><br>
*The bloodiest battle in the Unification War was the Battle of Ridgecrest. In just one day, at least 3,078 people were reported killed.
<br><br>
*North California and South California were on opposite sides of the war, allied with the Free States and the NUSA, respectively, while Night City maintained a position of neutrality.
<br><br>
*The Unification War ended when all parties signed the Treaty of Unification in Arvin, South California. Both sides claimed victory: the Free States emphasizing that they had preserved their independence, and the NUSA boasting that they were closer than ever to reunifying a divided American people.
<br><br>
*The end of the Unification War, however, was not an end to the conflict at large. The leading AI analytics software predicts another hot war will likely break out by 2080 (74% confidence).

## The Day the Tower Fell

<span class="cyberpunk-lightgreen">The Rescue - Can be found in the Scavenger Den.</span>
<hr class="cyberpunk-hr">
In early August 2023, a single event would change the course of history. Although it fell against the bloody backdrop of the Fourth Corporate War, the global media still fed on the story for weeks. And could you blame them? A group of terrorists detonated a nuclear bomb, blowing Arasaka Tower to pieces. The terrorists' warning came too late – not all of the Tower's employees could be evacuated. The blast itself killed and wounded thousands, while countless others died from radiation sickness. How did the biggest terrorist attack in the 21st century happen? Who was behind this catastrophe? To find the answers, we'll need to first understand the context of that era.
<br><br>
The early 2020's was a period of unrest for Night City and anti-corporate sentiment was at an all-time high. In the epicenter of the city's lawlessness stood the Atlantis club. It was seen as an island of resistance against the powers that be, primarily megacorporations like Militech or Biotechnica – though a special place in hell was reserved for Arasaka, the Japanese arms-manufacturing zaibatsu that held the most influence over Night City. The kinds of people who frequented the Atlantis felt that corporations had hijacked the future and turned people into consumer-slaves and ironically, deprived of the two things capitalism loved most – freedom and choice. These people called themselves Edgerunners. They positioned themselves against the corporate world order – they declared their own freedom and opposition to the status quo. But deprived of any peaceful way to meaningfully change what they called "the System," they reached for more radical methods of self-expression. And these people were no strangers to violence.

## The Undoing: Fall of the First Net

Chapter I: The Apocalypse
<br><br>
His name was Rache Bartmoss. Everyone knows WHO destroyed the first Net. The real question is WHY. NetWatch branded him a criminal and outlaw. The media called him a madman. Is either label correct? You be the judge. Below is a previously unpublished letter which Bartmoss put out just before the release of R.A.B.I.D.S. Why has this document only now just emerged? Well... Someone out there did not want you, my dear readers, to ever lay eyes on it. All the more reason to take a deep dive into the information available to us.<br>

<br><br>
The first Net was supposed save us. It would serve as a platform for those without a voice. It would offer unlimited knowledge to those who hungered for it. It would bring a fractured humanity closer together than ever before in our history. But these hopes were hollow. False.
<br><br>
The Net spread its tendrils around the globe faster than anyone could have predicted. Before anyone could even consider the full range of consequences. This "information superhighway" turned out to be our path straight to hell. We were robbed of our privacy, deprived of our free will, stripped of our dignity.
<br><br>
It was supposed to save us, but now even the Net itself cannot be saved. It was molded by the corps, with sharp edges, spikes and traps at every corner. Think of the Net as a stream of water that flows gently into our minds... before freezing, swelling, and destroying us from the inside out. But remember this about ice – as hard as it may be, it's surprisingly brittle. One well-placed strike and it shatters into a million tiny pieces. Watch out today and you'll see just what I mean.

## Why Be Me?: Confessions of a Braindance Addict
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-grey">
<hr class="cyberpunk-hr">
PREFACE
<br><br>
Do you want to be you?
<br><br>
Seriously. Take a moment to let that question sink in. Do you feel at home in your skin? Do you like your job? Your friends, your family? When you look in the mirror, do you say to yourself "I'm the luckiest person alive," then hop in the leather-upholstered backseat of your chauffeured Rayfield?
<br><br>
If you answered "yes" to any of those questions, put down this book and stop wasting your valuable time. If you answered "no" to the above, I understand how you feel.
<br><br>
It used to be said, at the turn of the century, that the world belongs to the "one percent." Today, one thousandth of a percent is closer to the truth. And your chances of joining this group are even less than that. In this reality, I mean - where you are you. In a braindance, you can be anyone. A broker who manages a portfolio worth trillions. An elite soldier who blasts his enemies out of existence with a tech shotgun. A suave rockerboy whom the whole world lusts after...
<br><br>
Now, I ask you again: Of the millions upon millions of people in this world, do you want to be you? The answer for me was always "no." And so my story begins. [...]

## The MaxTac Way, by Mathias Maddox
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-grey">
<hr class="cyberpunk-hr">
FOREWORD TO THE SECOND EDITION
<br><br>
I was fortunate, after publishing the first edition of this book, to meet many people with fascinating stories. I spoke with people who lost loved ones at the hands of cyberpsychos. I met the relatives of people whom I shot. Needless to say, not every conversation ended on good terms.
<br><br>
After some time, I learned what questions to expect from my readers. Have you ever been shot? (Yes, and I've lost count.) Who was the most difficult person to kill/arrest? (The 2063 Golden Springs Mall Killer - more titanium bone and synth-skin than man.) What causes cyberpsychosis? (I'll let you know when I find out!)
<br><br>
Then, at a book-signing in Heywood, I was asked a question I had never heard before: Is there anything that keeps me awake at night? After a moment's reflection, I realized the answer was yes. Perhaps most surprisingly, however, it was not nightmares of eviscerated cyberpsycho victims, nor the shrieks and cries of my squad mates as they burned alive. Cruel as it may sound, I grew used to that. It was just part of the job. No - what caused my heart to pound as I lie in bed late at night is the thought that one day I, too, could succumb to cyberpsychosis. The amount of cyberware I have incorporated into my body is substantial. Far more than most. I tried to drown the human parts of me that fear, that doubt. I am aware just how fragile my humanity is - that piece of myself deep within that makes me who I am. One poorly clipped neuron, one hormonal overdose, and that piece may disappear forever, leaving behind an automoton with only one desire: to kill. In truth, I forced my mind to race so I would not have to confront these thoughts.
<br><br>
Today, I still struggle with these demons, but I have asked my wife to keep a loaded pistol in her bedside table. If I begin to scream or rant incoherently in the middle of the night, I instructed her to empty the entire clip between my eyes. At first she objected, but our love is strong. It is thanks to my loving wife's promise that I sleep more soundly now than ever before in my life.

## In the Shadows of Megabuildings
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-grey">
<hr class="cyberpunk-hr">
One could say we're living in stable times. The 4th Corporate War is ancient history, the Unification War is over and done with, and Night City is a free city - a jewel embedded between two Californias. Living here, you might have the impression that everything is OK in the world. But look around.
<br><br>
The world is not OK. Despite technological recession between 2020 and 2040 reducing global pollution levels, humanity is still facing monumental existential threats. Climate change has turned into climate disaster - its effects are irreversible and dangerously unpredictable. Hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts, floods - natural catastrophes are growing in strength and frequency across the continent, leveling entire regions. Access to clean water is becoming increasingly more scarce, as well as fertile land. Hunger and starvation still reaps a bloody, human harvest in Asia and Africa, where corporations had no interest in building vertical, hydroponic farms.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, advances in cybermodification have given rise to a new problem:<br> cyberpsychosis. And though we've been aware of cyberpsychosis for over half a century, and know that incidents of cyberpsychosis are inextricably linked to a person's level of implantation, we still do not know why some are more prone to carrying out violent attacks than others. Let's not also forget the more serious issue of mass inequality, record high crime rates (including in places like Night City) and social unrest linked to immigration in almost every corner of the world...
<br><br>
So I ask you again - look around. You see all of these problems in Night City already. Maybe you're standing in the shadow of a megabuilding and you think, "Night City is Night City - the rest of the world's problems don't affect me, right?"
<br><br>
Right?

## Arasaka Academy: Best of the Best, or Best for the Best?
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-grey">
<hr class="cyberpunk-hr">
Arasaka Academy emerged as the #1 ranked institute of secondary education in Night City for the fourth consecutive time according to the Night City Perspective's annual review. The periodical earns the lion's share of its advertising revenue from the academy's namesake corporation, though their editorial staff claim this financial cooperation does not influence their rankings.
<br><br>
The magazine's education experts claim Arasaka Academy's infrastructure has no equal in Night City. Bias or otherwise, we cannot argue them on this point. Lessons are primarily conducted via virtual reality or AI-generated lesson plans suited to a student group's specific needs. Public schools, meanwhile, can only dream... It comes as no surprise, then, that parents who are not gainfully employed at a megacorp are increasingly willing to incur a lifetime of debt for a chance to give their child a chance at the city's most prestigious education.
<br><br>
But there are many uncomfortable truths the Academy is struggling to keep silent. Academy administrators promote a culture of constructive competition among its pupils as a way to forge the world's next great corporate executives. A rat race by another name with a diploma at the finish line...
<br><br>
Night City Perspective factors placement in corporate leadership roles into their calculations, and with this criterion I take no issue. What they don't include, however, is the drop-out rate. The enormous pressures these students face inevitably translate to anxiety, depression and, for some, even suicide. These rates are especially high for students outside the Arasaka corporate family. Such is the dark side of Arasaka Academy's glowing reputation.

## Pathfinder: Half a Century of Silence

When, in the summer of 2020, NASA's Pathfinder mission set off for Jupiter, it was the buzz of every radio station, TV media outlet, and screamsheet. Stills of the crew were plastered on every type of commemorative merchandise imaginable: mugs, shirts, plates, bobbleheads, bumper stickers, the list goes on.
<br><br>
But, just a week later, the steady stream of information dried to a tickle. A month later, the world had all but forgotten about them. Three years later, and two years before their planned entry into Jupiter's orbit, a conflict now known as the Fourth Corporate War broke out.
<br><br>
Cape Canaveral was one of the first strategic sites razed to the ground - NASA's mission control center along with it. Pathfinder, in the vast reaches of space, had been cut off. When the opposing sides finally signed a truce three years later, Militech set its sights on reestablishing contact with the Pathfinder crew, but to no avail. Pathfinder's signal, it seemed, had been swallowed by the void of the Big Black.
<br><br>
To this day, it remains unknown whether the Pathfinder mission was a success. If the crew ever did reach Jupiter and its moons, we have received no word, no data, not a single lead to follow. Maybe they never stood a chance. Maybe, after a half-century of silence, they simply have nothing to say to us.

## Yōkai: Japanese Demons of Yesterday and Today
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-grey">
<span class="cyberpunk-lightgreen">Can be found in Konpeki Plaza, after taking out the first two Arasaka Guards.<br>
Can be found inside Hiromi Sato's apartment in Megabuilding H8, on a table near the door to his office.</span>
<hr class="cyberpunk-hr">
They make their homes on mountaintops, in rivers and oceans, on city streets and on every megabuilding floor with the number 4 in it, even in your washing machine or infovisor. Some appear in concrete places, while others simply haunt a specific person. They're there when you hear a strange noise in the middle of the desert. They're there when you feel like someone's watching you, although there's not a soul in sight. They're there when you glimpse something out of the corner of your eye, something nobody else seems to notice, but you were just at the ripperdoc's for your checkup!
<br><br>
The yōkai first appear in Japanese literature in the year 797. These mysterious beings, though closely linked to the invisible realm of the dead, have been alive in the Japanese consciousness from the very birth of animism. It's not that the Japanese believe in the yōkai. They simply know the yōkai exist.
<br><br>
[...] In addition to phantoms, ogres and other mysterious phenomena, the yōkai also include a group of shape-shifting demons called obake or bakemono. The bakemono are said to sometimes take the form of a faceless person, a one-eyed scarecrow or an animal.
<br><br>
[...]It's said that when a cat reaches a certain age, it becomes a bakeneko. These yōkai are able to walk on their two hind legs, speak and dance, assume human form or even devour their owners and take their place. The bakeneko sometimes visit people in their sleep, or even wake the dead – all they have to do is hop over a corpse to bring it suddenly back to life.
<br><br>
However, the demons are capable of much, much more. One should exercise extreme caution around a double tailed cat. This is a nekomata, a yōkai with shamanic and necromantic capabilities, able to place curses on people and control the dead. In its human form, a nekomata resembles an old woman, often one addicted to some substance or other and with an eerie, disturbing air about her.
<br><br>
However, let me assure American readers of this book; today, the most likely place you'll find a bakeneko is in the form of lucky Maneki-neko figurines. After all, real cats are an even rarer sight these days than your average yōkai.

## Water, Chrome and Blood - THE FOURTH CORPORATE WAR
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-grey">
<hr class="cyberpunk-hr">
(...) It is truly remarkable that the large-scale bloodshed of the Fourth Corporate War began first as a simple rivalry between two ocean exploitation corporations: CINO and OTEC. Both companies vied for the controlling stake of the failing IHA corporation. OTEC commissioned Militech to secure its business interests and perform certain "special operations." CINO, in turn, signed a cooperation agreement with the Arasaka Corporation with a similar aim. When circumstances at last called for both colossal and prideful security corporations to clash in open combat, the Fourth Corporate War had officially begun.
<br><br>
Yet, as is usually the case with corporate conflicts, the onset proved subtle: Arasaka disables a Militech transport, Militech (allegedly) eliminates a high-ranking official of an Arasaka client, both sides engage in frequent sabotage and data theft operations, netrunners from both sides infiltrate dataforts to sow confusion, gather intel and cause chaos in the stock markets. Though none would have thought it possible in those early months, the Arasaka-Militech conflict truly jeopardized the stability of the world economy, making the threat of complete economic collapse all too real. For this reason, NetWatch introducted a communications embargo on both corporations. This did little to slow the conflict's pace, however. While CINO and OTEC had unilaterally reached a settlement and reach an understanding through "peace talks," tension between Arasaka and Militech continued to rise. This separation from the ocean dispute marks the beginning of the Fourth War's second phase: the so-called Shadow War.
<br><br>
Military clashes between Militech and Arasaka were notoriously bloody, brutal and without mercy, they waged their most damaging campaigns on the Net. Arasaka and Militech netrunners launched attacks with the help of viruses that were often highly experimental. What's more, they created lethal ICE measures and AI-like programs that could lurk in dark corners of the Net for long periods to make strikes at the most opportune times. 
<br><br>
By the second half of 2022, Arasaka and Militech entered the final phase of the conflict where both sides used every resource and strategy at their disposal. The Hot War had begun. Around this time, the Net that the world had known for years ceased to exist, and mercenaries hired by both corporations were slaughtered in open warfare fought with the cutting-edge weapons technology. Then, in the War's most shocking and iconic turning point, the coup de grâce came when an unknown group of mercenaries denoted a nuclear device at Arasaka's Night City headquarters. Shortly after the blast, bowing under increased pressure from the Japanese government, Arasaka laid down its arms and withdrew from many of its strategic positions, but most notably in Night City. Victory belonged to Militech, but it came at a heavy cost. (...)

## Lat-Am Wars
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-grey">
<hr class="cyberpunk-hr">
As a direct result of the armed conflicts on U.S. soil from the early 1990s until the early 2000s, Latin America (comprising South and Central America) remodeled itself into a strong federation of independent nations, bound through mutual aid and cooperation.
The U.S.'s military presence was forced from Latin American terrorities with the exception of Panama, where it stood its ground despite fierce pressure from guerilla forces.
<br><br>
Many researchers and contemporary historians maintain that, in fact, the Lat-Am Wars were responsible for the U.S.'s eventual collapse, breaking up the Gang of Four (CIA, FBI, DEA and NSA) and decimating the U.S. Army. However, it's important to bear in mind that no external conflict could have toppled the colossus of American imperialism were it not already built on clay foundations.

## Protein Farms: A Report
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-grey">
<hr class="cyberpunk-hr">
Protein farms are currently the source of most meat and meat-substitute products in Night City. Biotechnica is the clear industry leader, providing for over half of the city's demand for alternative protein. Currently, the most popular, albeit cost-intensive form of production is based on protein-rich crickets, which allow producers to achieve the highest-quality protein. Earthworms are available as a cheaper alternative, achieving a higher yield of product per square meter. However, worms pose a more difficult marketing challenge - while crickets have become acceptable, most consumers still bristle at being told to "go eat worms."

## Avian Extermination Act
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-grey">
<hr class="cyberpunk-hr">
The AEA was adopted by the Night City Council on May 04, 2063.
<br><br>
Purpose: In the face of increasingly frequent and deadly zoonotic disease outbreaks, the City Council has decided that the most effective method for reducing the risk of infection among residents is via the extermination of all avian life within 18 miles of city limits (See Fig.1)
<br><br>
The extermination process will begin on May 07, 2063 once the call and selection of tenders for the contract have been completed (See Annex 2).

## Outer Space! My Life in Orbit
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-grey">
<hr class="cyberpunk-hr">
What's life in space like? Comfortable.
<br><br>
Of course, not everything's a bed of roses. Gravity below 1g isn't great for your bones or muscles. Synthesized food isn't to die for, and stuff from Earth is as rare as it is expensive. If you live in a private orbital station (congrats, you're richer than me!), you always see the same faces. But if you live in a hybrid station like Crystal Palace, you'll have to live with corporat bachelor parties every weekend. But don't let that put you off! There are more upsides than downsides to living in orbit.
<br><br>
First of all: safety. To get into orbit you need a lot of zeroes in your bank account, which means you won't see legions of homeless people, skezzed out gangsters or aggressive joytoys (the exception to that being the Lunar colonies, but no self-respecting Orbital-dweller would ever set foot there). In other words - you can walk outside at night unarmed, without security, and come back home in one piece, wallet undisturbed. Amazing, right?
<br><br>
Secondly: quality of service. Anyone in the customer service sector had to rack up an enormous debt to come up here. Their only hope to pay it off within their lifetimes is to rake in a lot (and I mean A LOT) of tips, which means they'll bend over backwards to satisfy every whim. if you're an employer, you don't have to worry that an employee you just hired and trained at your expense will suddenly quit and go work for the competition for a few extra eddies a week. Many stations, especially the private ones, simply don't have competition, and if they do it's basically negligible - agreements can be made so situations like that don't occur.
<br><br>
Thirdly, and most importantly: no government can tell you what to do, where and how. Orbital stations are autonomous and governed by their own laws... and there aren't that many of them. If you can afford your own station, you're the undisputed lord and master of your little corner of space. You want to tie the help up to a whipping post when they make a mistake? Go right ahead. Want five wives or four husbands? I'm sure you'll have a line of willing volunteers.
</div>
