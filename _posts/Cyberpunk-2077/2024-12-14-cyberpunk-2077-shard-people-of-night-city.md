## Tamed Dragon: A Biography of Yorinobu Arasaka
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
In many ways, the story of Yorinobu Arasaka resembles an ancient parable. The younger son of one of the modern world's most powerful CEOs renounces his heritage, forfeits his birthright, and instead chooses a rough-and-tumble life on the streets of Tokyo only to later scamper back home to the warm, sheltered bosom of his family with his tail tucked. At least, that is the story most have pieced together from official sources. But why did Yorinobu betray his father in the first place? Why did he return? For several years, I dug deeper, followed leads, reached out to his former friends and acquaintances. Slowly, I began to unearth answers to some of the public's most burning questions.
<br><br>
Yorinobu was born in Tokyo in the early twenty-first century, the first child to Saburo Arasaka's third wife, Michiko. By all accounts, he seemed a happy child that grew to become a pleasant young man; that is, until his graduation from the University of Tokyo at the age of 21. Following the ceremony, the Arasaka family threw a party in his honor. At some point in the evening, Saburo invited his son to his study for a private conversation. What transpired there is wholly unknown, but after corroborating varied accounts, it is clear Yorinobu must have slipped out of from the party and the estate only a few hours later. Gone. A whisper in the night.
<br><br>
Over the next few years, various eyewitnesses spotted Yorinobu in the company of a nomad group known as Kotetsu no Ryu, or the "Steel Dragons." As part of this youthful rebellion, he purposefully involved himself in altercations with Arasaka agents and promoted anti-corporate slogans. After his family eventually confirmed Yorinobu's involvement, Saburo renounced his son and Kei, Saburo's eldest son, swore to exact revenge on his younger brother. Ironically, it was later at Kei's funeral that Yorinobu at last reconciled with his father. Stubbornly proud to a fault, many were suprised[sic] by the Arasaka patriarch's conciliatory approach. What caused Saburo to change his mind? What role might have Yorinobu's sister, Hanako, played in their peaceable reunion? That much yet remains to be discovered...

## The Flowers of Silence. A biography of Hanako Arasaka.
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
If I had written this biography on the basis of publicly available material, there would be two sides of this story, not to mention the foreword, afterword, and the acknowledgments.
<br><br>
Everyone knows that Hanako Arasaka is a very private individual. Everyone has heard about the tragic death of the last reporter who attempted to pen her life's story. Ten shots to the back. Suicide, according to the police.
<br><br>
That's why when my publisher asked me to write this book, I had to politely decline. Then when I saw the advance they were offering me, I started to reconsider. And finally, when I discovered that Arasaka's PR department had given its stamp of approval to interview numerous members of Hanako's entourage, I was on the next flight to Tokyo.
<br><br>
Soon enough, however, I lost my original enthusiasm. The people Arasaka sent me to be interviewed repeated the same answers to all questions - clearly memorized by heart. After a month's worth of research all I had was:
<br><br>
Hanako Arasaka is the daughter of Saburo Arasaka from his third wife, Michiko. She was born in 1999 in Tokyo and has only left the city five times in her life. Living a cloistered lifestyle, she never fulfilled any important role in the family business. She is very close to Yorinobu Arasaka, the black sheep in the family.
<br><br>
I was ready to give up when in the archives of a local T.V. station I found a recording of the opening of an Arasaka branch in Fukuoka, graced by the presence of none other than Hanako herself. She played the piano. Debussy's "Reverie." Why that piece? Why play a dreamy, introspective song while surrounded by stoic Japanese businessmen? Her golden fingers caressed the keys. I was mesmerized. Tears rolled down my cheeks as I listened. That's when I knew I had to finish this book. I had to meet this enigmatic woman and find out who Hanako Arasaka really was.

## California After Dusk: The Life of Richard Night
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
Richard Night was a pessimist. Even in the late Eighties, when the economy seemed headed for endless growth and the nuclear threat for the ash heap of history, Night saw the United States as hurtling toward collapse.
<br><br>
Richard Night was an optimist. He deeply believed the world could be changed for the better – and that he was the one to do it.
<br><br>
Richard Night was a realist. Aware he couldn't change the face of the world all at once, he decided to start small (for him, at least) by constructing the ideal city. His utopian metropolis was to be called Coronado City. It would stand as a metaphorical city on a hill, a shining example to the rest of the world.
<br><br>
Richard Night was doomed to fail. Not because his vision was inherently impossible to realize, but because many important, powerful people wished to make it so.
<br><br>
Richard Night was murdered. The city whose foundations he laid was finished after his death – but his utopian dream soon became a dystopian nightmare. Even the original name was lost. In honor of the city's tragically deceased founder, Coronado City was rechristened "Night City." Ironically, the name fits. If anything, the city is a cat; sleepy during the day, it comes frantically alive at night. And it loves to toy with its prey.

## Who is Dr. Paradox?
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
Who is Doc Paradox? Who's hiding behind the distorted mask?
<br><br>
Unsurprisingly, Doc Paradox won't say. After all, he's breaking the law - he has to protect his identity. If he revealed even the tiniest sliver about himself, NetWatch agents would be at his door in less than a minute.
<br><br>
But think about it. THINK. What kind of person could successfully hide from the world's most powerful corporations for years? Who could hack into encrypted T.V. channels? Who would disclose highly classified corporate secrets?
<br><br>
The answer's obvious. Doc Paradox is one of them. He's a puppet controlled by the establishment. To what end? Maybe this is how corporations funnel our anger and frustration in a safe and controlled manner, through a rebel who will never go so far as to issue a call to arms. Maybe he's being used to reveal "facts" that hurt the competition. Or maybe he's just a branding opportunity? In a month or two, Avante could put out a new, "Doc Paradox" line for us to wear our disapproval?
<br><br>
Only time will tell. But for christ's sake, don't listen to a word out of this phoney's mouth.

## Stop complaining - Get rich today! by Josh Kavorkin
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
The first and most important lesson: you, and only you, are responsible for your situation in life. Don't wait for the government to take pity on you, don't wait for your loved ones to lend a helping hand - just pull yourself up by your bootstraps and get to work! I know what you're going to say - unemployment is at 34%. But so what? What's stopping you from starting your own business? It's that damn simple! What's that? You say you need an education? So educate yourself, for chrissakes! From now on, I don't want to hear any excuses. What matters is that you can be rich too - but you have to WANT it! And for that, you have to WORK for it!
