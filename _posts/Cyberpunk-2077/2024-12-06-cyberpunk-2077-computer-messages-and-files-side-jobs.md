Hey Barry,<br>
Just wanted to check in - see if everything's OK. The way you just quit all of a sudden... was that because of Andrew? I'm sure he was a great guy and all, but... life goes on. There are lots of good people out there. Who's gonna protect them if hardworking blues like you go quitting the force?<br>

Barry,<br>
How come you're not answering? You don't talk to anyone, you don't go out... you can't blame a person for thinking the worst. You still worried about all that... y'know, stuff? Don't you think you're overreacting just a teeny bit?<br>
