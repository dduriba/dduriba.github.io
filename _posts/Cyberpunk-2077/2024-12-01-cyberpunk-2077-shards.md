## Emergency on Demand
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
How did it happen? When and why did we as a society decide that human life is a commodity? A luxury?
<br><br>
My mother passed away at 45. She still had decades of life to live until it was all stolen from her by common pneumonia. If she had held even the cheapest Trauma Team policy, she could have been cured within an hour. But she couldn't afford it. My mother died five months before her scheduled appointment with our family practitioner...
<br><br>
The idea of privatized healthcare is deeply ingrained in our public psyche. Already in 2020, there was widespread consensus that 500 eurodollars a month was a fair price for Trauma Team insurance. Health wasn't something you were given, it was something you earned. The private system may not be perfect, but there's no alternative, we thought.
<br><br>
BULLSHIT.
<br><br>
Now cross the Pacific Ocean to the USSR where they also have highly trained medical technicians, high-precision nanosurgical suites, specialized antibodies, intravenous probes, the list goes on. Emergency airlifts using modern AVs equipped with cryotonic chambers? They have those, too. The difference, then? They don't leave their people to die on the streets, at the store, in their homes. They don't force anyone to purchase their lives from a corporation as if they're the ones who own it.
<br><br>
Public healthcare isn't some unachievable utopia. It is a REALITY.
<br><br>
Trauma Team, on the other hand, treats its policyholders as both potential patients to be treated and potential products to be bought. They save lives only because there is profit in it. A saved life is a returning customer. Client death can also bring in fiscal gains in the form of organ and implant resale, though of course in regulated, smaller sums. An emergency care provider can't afford to give its managers reasons to deliberately kill off its clientele base for short-term windfalls.
<br><br>
Surely, you ask, these medical "professionals" are also guided by their Hippocratic Oaths?
<br><br>
Please...

## New Release Braindances
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
What's up, BD-maniacs? Hungry for a new emo-rush? Then check out the latest word from the freshest BDs on the market.
<br><br>
Foreign Body<br>
The body is everything. There is nothing else. It is you, but it is also just a tool for your mind to interact with the world. But what would happen if this tool tried to live its own life? What if it tried... to kill you?
Though not a particularly original addition to the thriller genre, this braindance featuring Luke Poller is still a solid experiential ride. The fear of disobedient implants has been around since pirates were walking around on peg legs – well, maybe not that long – as a result, the trope has been pervasive in film, braindance, and urban legend alike. Still, "Foreign Body" borrows some of the genre's best elements while still incorporating just enough new stuff to the mix to keep it interesting. After all, it's not every day you see the world from the perspective of a sentient arm.
<br><br>
Maxwell's Rehab<br>
This braindance season has been chock full of horror, but this one stands out from the rest. The always phenomenal Maxwell Ramirez is pushed to the brink of cyberpsychosis so we can relive his return to normalcy. The title offers a tone of optimism, but don't let that fool you. You will relive Maxwell's slip into psychosis, the heartbreak of his wife, and the gradual reintegration into a world that is now far different from how he left it. This BD is a must-relive of the season, but it's not for the faint of heart.
<br><br>
Badlands Raid<br>
At last, a BD for those looking for something a little lighter. "Badlands Raid" is a remake of the 2023 classic, which was an innovative tour de force of the time. For those of you unfamiliar, the plot revolves around an ordinary, boring guy who accidentally gets tangled up in a nomad ambush on a Zetatech convoy. I won't spoil it because, even though the main plot hasn't changed in 54 years, most people these days probably don't know the ending. What I will say is this: the remake's creators have introduced a few modern twists into the story that should make for a pleasant surprise to classics-lovers and newbies alike.

## The Relic – why all the fuss?
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
For years, experts in the field of cybernetics, neurology and psychology have been desperately trying to merge human consciousness with silicon. Until now, their efforts have been unsuccessful - though scientists have managed to create artificial intelligences that can compare, or indeed, surpass human intellect, copying the human "I" has remained beyond our capabilities. Attempts to do so have merely resulted in sophisticated chatbots - digital beings capable of mimicking human speech and mannerisms, but devoid of self-awareness.
<br><br>
Today, experts from Arasaka announced a breakthrough. Their newest project, dubbed the "Relic," allows human minds to be copied onto shards no larger than a credchip.
What's more, the shard can be slotted into one's neural port, allowing its user to "hear" and "see" digitized personality constructs.
<br><br>
Sadly, I haven't been able to personally examine the specifications of this remarkable piece of technology. Access to the Relic is heavily restricted by Arasaka, and only a small, select group of testers are allowed to participate in the program. Unsurprisingly, these testers are among the wealthiest and most influential people in the world - precisely the kinds of people Arasaka would like to have in its pocket. For the ordinary consumers reading this - don't expect the Relic to hit mass markets anytime soon.

## Big 5 Employers in Night City – 2077
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">

<br><br>
1. Arasaka – Coming in again this year in our #1 spot the Japanese zaibatsu juggernaut. Employees can expect to be fit with the latest in cyberware technology with a loyalty obligation of only 20 years!
<br><br>
2. Militech – The American arms giant provides its employees with up to 50% discounts on all Militech weapons. With a deal that good, you'd be able to put a Mk.31 Heavy Machine Gun under the Christmas tree for everyone in the family!
<br><br>

## Healthcare and Traffic Safety – Trauma Team Leads the Way
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
Second-rate equipment, under-trained medical "professionals", and high death rates – this is the best Night City's public emergency services have to offer. In addition to poor performance metrics, so too has their public image suffered. Scandals involving city EMTs colluding with scavengers have gone from rare to commonplace.
<br><br>
Recent cuts in municipal healthcare spending have led to the outright collapse of a medical system that already underperformed by most standards in the developed world. Ironically, this so-called "reform" resulted in a greater drain of doctors, nurses, paramedics and dispatchers from the public sector. Where quality healthcare was spotty before, now too is even calling the emergency hotline. Should you be among the lucky to reach a dispatcher, expect more than a half hour for an ambulance to arrive. And should you not bleed out before reaching the hospital, you're even less likely to find an available bed. Recent data show a survival rate for traffic accidents in Night City at a meager 17%.
<br><br>
For comparison, the average survival rate for traffic accidents across all Trauma Team policies is 91%. Response time is guaranteed to never exceed 3 minutes. Heaven on Earth? No. The minimum we all deserve. Something to keep in mind as you plan your personal budget... Purchase Trauma Team's Platinum-level coverage for the cost of Gold and safeguard your life today.

## Left Jab: Boxer's Monthly
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
Kazuo Kano – ronin from Osaka
<br><br>
Kazuo Kano's name is on the lips of everyone in the boxing world. The up-and-coming light heavyweight remains undefeated after twenty professional fights, seventeen of which were won by technical knockout.<br>
Some accuse Kano of doping, others say he has connections with the Yakuza. While training in Night City, the light heavyweight was allegedly seen "receiving" guests from Japan in his gym. Afterwards they were then seen being carried out of the gym unconscious. Wide scars have been visible near Kano's ribs for the last three fights. Local ripperdocs say that the scars definitely do not look like an appendix removal procedure... 
Will Kano become the light heavyweight champion of the world? We'll see after Malone takes his revenge on Hernandez.

## The Mox
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
(...)It's one of those stories that is either very simple or very complicated, depending on who you ask. For Janice, it was a mix of both: "The Mox came to exist because it had to. We didn't have a soul in our corner, no one to make sure street justice was on our side. So we took matters into our own hands."
<br><br>
The Mox is composed of the people who, if any of them disappeared from the streets tomorrow, you might never even notice: sex workers, ennyless artists, aimless rebels, and restless souls who weren't dealt a fair hand. Today, the Mox is thriving, as demonstrated by the booming biz of Lizzie's Bar. Lizzie's is renown for being arguably the best braindance club in Night City. Corporate suits, gangoons, pop stars, and locals alike all gather at Lizzie's to kick back, have a drink, and dip into the most beautifully scrolled and tuned BDs you've ever experienced. Most customers, however, are oblivious to the fact that the club is gang owned and operated, that the Mox are in charge, watching after their own. Just like the Lizzie of legend once did.
<br><br>
Know the story? "Lizzied used to work here back when it was just a typical dive with a stripper pole," Janice proudly explained. "She took care of the girls, made sure eddies were falling into the pockets... and their teeth weren't falling to the curb. Like this one time, this fucker (Editor's note: referring to a Tyger Claws gang member) was having too much "fun" with one of the girls, and Lizzie just couldn't stomach it anymore. Story is she deprived the worm of his little Tyger balls so quick and nasty it took them two days to clean up all the blood and puke splatter. 'Course, the Claws found out fast and they flatlined her in a flash. But everyone that she had impacted in some way, they were still around. They came together, fought back and-- (pause) Well... you already know the rest."

## NC Night Life – Drinks, Dancing, Debauchery
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
(...) If you're a dancehead like us, don't miss out on LIZZIE'S. You'll find no better braindance club in the city, no matter how deep you dig. Modern boxes, solid tech, but most important: the catalogue, chock-full of nearly any exp you can imagine. You'll find everything you need to get you off - fast or slow, nasty or classy, and everything in-between. Don't let the girls at the front door scare you off or kill your buzz - they're wary of newcomers, but once you get in they'll treat you like one of their own. Trust us, give LIZZIE'S a try and you'll never go anywhere else. 
<br><br>
Now, THE AFTERLIFE? That's a different story. Sure, you can cut loose and have a good time here, but THE AFTERLIFE is a place of business above all else. Want to meet with a fixer about a job that needs doing? Discuss important gig details with a client over drinks? Or maybe just sit back and people watch, to see the comings and goings of the NC underworld's biggest merc and fixer names? THE AFTERLIFE is a great place for all of the above. The only place, really. 
<br><br>
If you're looking for the city's marquee events, you'll find yourself at RIOT. Chart-topping playlists, live performances from the brightest stars (both local and from around the world), DJ battles, unique music shows, and media-packed album premieres - sound like your scene? Don't miss out on RIOT. (...)

## How to keep your shards and data safe from picksockets! [TOP 3 WAYS]
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
Are you reading this on the street? In a store? In the metro? When was the last time you checked your neural sockets?
<br><br>
The picksocket plague is worse than it's ever been. The NCPD received hundreds of complaints in their last cycle from residents who reported having shards stolen from their neural sockets. How can you protect yourself? We've got you covered!
<br><br>
Thefts largely go uninvestigated due to the police's prioritization of violent crime, which has left picksockets feeling increasingly bold. Exploits used to hack our neuralware are widely available on the black market, so many thieves have shifted focus from our pockets to our sockets. One brief moment of inattention and your private information is flying from your neck into someone's sticky fingers. The NCPD admits tracking such thieves is difficult and a waste of resources, which is why we're here to help keep your info safe with 3 options to suit any budget.
<br><br>
1. Change your settings to ensure you receive notifications any time a shard is removed from a neural port. Unfortunately, this approach leads to a high number of false positives when you're fiddling with your own neuralware.<br>
2. Invest in new sockets. Several new models on the market already have built-in safety and authorization measures to keep shards locked in tight. But if you're pinching every enny, this solution could break the bank.<br>
3. Duct tape. Slap on a square of that and those shards aren't going anywhere. On a budget? Bad with tech? No regard for style? Then this is the option for you!

## A Family of Empire
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
The legacy of Arasaka needs no introduction. The Arasaka Corporation is one of the world's most powerful, with offices located in every major metropolis across the globe. For years, it has been behind the proverbial wheel of our planet's economy and society. The history of Arasaka in Night City is deserving of its own article, but suffice to say, the media industry in our city follows the family behind the megacorp as closely as they do share prices.
<br><br>
The story of the Arasaka family is one of empire – a true dynasty under the rule of patriarch Saburo Arasaka. Rumors of the great Saburo's retirement and cession of company control (as well as of its closely guarded secrets) to his daughter, Hanako, and son, Yorinobu, have come and passed in recent years. But has the time come where such rumors may finally contain a grain of truth?
<br><br>
Our sources report that Yorinobu Arasaka is currently in Night City, but not for a social call. And yet, if Yorinobu is strategizing a move for the throne, what of Hanako? Experts who follow the family closely unanimously agree that – due to "ideological" differences between Saburo and Yorinobu – Hanako will likely cement herself as the one true heir to the immense fortune and power of the Arasaka family. However, reality is hardly ever so predictable. Familial power dynamics can shift in an instant. For example, what would happen if Hanako fell from favor at a time when Yorinobu had his father's ear? And what scenario might cause such a fall?
<br><br>
No family is without its secrets, and the Arasakas are no exception. After all... "What appears first as heaven, appears second as hell." – Japanese proverb.

## The vampire prince is back!
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
Monster hunters beware!
<br><br>
"Turbo Dracula" is a dark, gritty, visceral action game experience where you play as the plasma-thirsty prince of puncture wounds himself – Dracula! He has risen again, this time as a digi-clone in a body of chrome... but his appetite for blood hasn't waned one bit. Assisted by the descendants of an ancient bloodline, he wages war against the sinister HelsingCorp headed by the demon brothers Manchester. They aim to take over the world with the help of genetically spliced werewolf-zombies. Dracula must face difficult choices such as whether to resurrect his old friend Viago or to transmutate into his nemeses!
<br><br>
A polished real-time combat system and non-linear storyline offer the player deep immersion in singleplayer, while the multiplayer mode allows you to team up with your choombas as they take control of the brooding Varney or blonde fan favorite Herbert. Without spoiling any of the endings (yes, multiple endings!), I'll leave you with just one thing... Lady Carmilla Ruthven-Batory is hands down the most captivating character ever written in the hundred-year history of video games. Period.

## No Life 3 - Review
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
After fifty long years, the wait is finally over! The third and final installment of the No Life series will be available for purchase TOMORROW! As has been reported already, gamers should not expect any major shakeups in regard to the protagonist. We still play as strong-silent-type scientist Baron Freimensch. We follow Baron as he ventures to the Arctic Circle to... Well, why spoil it when you'll have your hands on it in less than 24 hours! The gist: with Alice at Baron's side and trusty crowbar in hand, those nasty aliens are in for a rude awakening.

## The Struggle of O'Neill Station.
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
The European Space Agency (ESA) started out with seemingly noble intentions: "We'll open the door to the universe." "The Solar System - a home to all." And so on an so forth.
<br><br>
It didn't take long for these catchphrases to reveal themselves for what they truly were - colonial ambitions wrapped up in lofty ideals. We, the builders and first inhabitants of O'Neill 1 have witnessed this first-hand. The ESA sent us into space with promises of a new life and a better tomorrow. Instead, what lay in wait for us was a complete lack of freedom and back-breaking work in extremely dangerous conditions.
<br><br>
We would've pulled through, we would've toughed it out for the greater good - if only they treated us as human beings, informed us of their decisions, listened to our concerns and requests... But the ESA ignored us.
<br><br>
The consequences were inevitable - in 2022, after completing construction of the station, our situation was critical. Station management demanded eighteen hours of work every day, seven days a week from everyone - regardless of age or health condition. Our peaceful protest was met with a disproportionate use of force, which included stun-guns. They thought it would break us, just like the countless protests they broke back on Earth.
<br><br>
The thing is, out here it's not so easy to call for reinforcements. Workers outnumbered guards 40:1, and one stun-gun charge held only fifteen rounds. The ESA's management had effectively shot themselves in the foot. It was over before they could realize - only seven hours passed before O'Neill 1 and O'Neill 2 declared independence and became the first nations established outside of Earth...

## Who is Lizzy Wizzy pretending to be?
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
"We are who we pretend to be. I've pretended to be everything - that's why I've found the truth."
<br><br>
Lizzy Wizzy is an artist par excellence. Her work includes award-winning albums and concert tours, film appearances as well as (for lack of a better term) conceptual performance art. Her latest artistic obsession features the medium of braindance. In recent interviews, Lizzy has mused about the boundary between our documentation of reality versus our active shaping of it. Could that mean Lizzy Wizzy plans to scroll her own BD? We can only dream! The chance to live just one day in her chrome skin... Fans would go wild!

## What Really Happened in Arasaka Tower?
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
[...] If Militech was behind the assault on Arasaka Tower in 2023, and if there's actual EVIDENCE to support that, then why didn't Arasaka return the favor and nuke Militech?
<br><br>
By now there's no doubt the bomb was manufactured by Militech, but that doesn't mean they detonated it. I confess, I'm not a huge fan of the popular theory that Johnny Silverhand, the controversial rockerboy, was behind the whole thing. In fact, I'm not really a Silverhand fan, period. Silverhand was a poser and a blowhard - not someone who would actually follow through on his grandiose bluffs (full disclosure, I just don't think Silverhand would have the balls to pull off something like that).
<br><br>
Let's think this through - who hates corporations the most?
<br><br>
Nomads, obviously. Remember that mass-market BD called "Badlands Raid" from the 20s about a band of nomads who attack a Militech convoy? Well, guess when it premiered? That's right - on the night of the attack. Coincidence? I think not.
<br><br>
Yes, yes, there's a Silverhand cameo in there somewhere, but that's just a marketing ploy - a BD scrolled by a bunch of cactus-huggers wouldn't sell for an enny without a recognizable face. But I'm more intrigued by the main actress - how is it she didn't star in any other production despite "Badlands Raid's" huge sales? Where was she during the attack?

## Arasaka and Ornithology: Three Japanese Words to Know
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
As conversations over factionalism within Arasaka heat up, many industry insiders wonder about the company's future trajectory. If you struggle to understand the complicated inner machinations of the world's largest arms manufacturer, look no further than the obscure science of ornithology. Yes, that's right; the study of birds can help. At least, in a sense. There are three Japanese words every corporate player ought to be familiar with: kiji, hato, and taka.
<br><br>
Kiji - green pheasant. This bird has long held cultural and symbolic significance in Japan. One can admire the world's last living specimens at Hanako Arasaka's private preserve on the island of Shikoku. But the word "kiji" also bears meaning among the factional identities within Arasaka. This group, with Hanako at its center, consists primarily of conservative technocrats who wish to follow the course set by Saburo Arasaka himself.
In his daughter, Hanako, they see a guiding force to maintain the old order and stability within the corporation..
<br><br>
Hato - dove. The symbolism of the dove is recognized far and wide. The symbol also aptly captures the character of the a much smaller faction within the company led by Michiko Arasaka, daughter of the late Kei and niece to Hanako.* This liberal wing of the corporation has unified those who seek deeper reforms. Although they currently hold little influence, they enjoy growing support popularity among some politicians and media personalities.
<br><br>
Taka - hawk. As symbolic as the dove is, so, too, is the hawk. This faction, headed by Yorinobu Arasaka, often prefers to take the most direct and uncompromising solutions. Both stubborn and temperamental, he resembles Saburo which has given him wide support among the more militant-minded Arasaka Corp. elite. However, his more pro-Western inclinations and ideas that are innovative as they are controversial have weakened his support from the Board's loyal traditionalists.
<br><br>
* You can learn more about Arasaka family genealogy from the eight-book series "Two Centuries in the Clover's Shadow." Available in stores soon.

## Storm on the Mare Crisium
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
By now we're all avid viewers of the reality TV show that is orbital politics. 
Except this is real life, and what happens up there could have real consequences for all of us down here. Recently everyone's been talking about the attack on Ursula Correira, resulting in the complete loss of control in the lower half of her body. The media has been endlessly replaying remarks made by Correira's younger brother, Vagner, while also discussing the latest outfit worn by Yara Ayoade to the official press conference where she denied rumors that Correira's family had any hand in her "accident."
<br><br>
I don't know about all of you, but with each passing day, the saying "What happens in orbit, stays in orbit" is starting to sound like dangerously wishful thinking.

## The Last Rockerboy: The Solo Career of Kerry Eurodyne
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
The friendship between Johnny Silverhand and Kerry Eurodyne as well as the trauma behind Johnny's mysterious disappearance have contributed to the cloak of misinformation that has obscured the true story of Samurai for years. The stubbornly loyal Eurodyne always kept silent about the foundational leadership role he held in the cult band. To the detriment of his own career, he paid full tribute to Silverhand, granting him full authorship over the band's songs.
<br><br>
Following Samurai's disintegration and a personal retreat to the Philippines where Kerry rediscovered his creative roots, Eurodyne cut ties from the past and began the next chapter of his legacy. Today, it has become clear beyond doubt that his own successes not only match those of Samurai's, but have repeatedly surpassed them. Kerry's effortless, natural charisma and strong stage presence electrify crowds without fail. By comparison, Silverhand's fiery shouts and political grandstanding appear now as nothing more than ordinary attention grabbing designed to mask the otherwise pedestrian quality of his musical talent.

## The Foodie Guide to Night City
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
The world traveler in Night City is faced with a dilemma: Enjoy the local cuisine? Or save their gut the trouble? If you don't own a Trauma Team policy, you're probably better off sticking to the tried-and-tested chains and exclusive restaurants. But if you do, Night City is full of risk that packs a lot of reward. Here's our risk-reward breakdown of Night City's good eats.
<br><br>
For the cautious consumer:
<br><br>
Bleu - A gourmet dining experience with some of the highest accolades and richest portfolios in the city. If you're after high-quality, locally sourced ingredients, Bleu is the place for you. Among its marquee dishes are authentic caviar, oysters, and imported Prosecco. The alabaster white interior adorned with minimalist décor is perfect for a relaxing night out following a day of hustle and bustle.
<br><br>
Pepper & Spice - A unique locale on the culinary map of Night City. This eatery was founded by renowned travel icon Tony Haleek. It stands apart from the competition thanks to its diverse menu of transcontinental fusion dishes, most of which are offered at surprisingly reasonable prices. Caribbean, Polish, Kenyan - it's all here. Just not in the combination you've ever seen before... The crowd favorite? Haleek's own vanilla dumplings.
<br><br>
For the gutsy gourmand:
<br><br>
Buck-A-Slice - According to urban legend, the NCPD has en entire file on the mysterious deaths of homeless people whose last meal was pizza from Buck-A-Slice. True or not, bargain-seekers living on a eurodollar-a-lunch budget should still be prepared for gastrointestinal distress. Worth the risk? Only if you want a greasy slice of authentic Night City flavor. Plus, their secret recipe chilispurt scopperoni is unlike anything you've ever tasted, but only available on special request.
<br><br>
Ru Lai - At Ru Lai you'll find all of the three P's - potent, punchy and pungent. Every visit to this local favorite is like playing a game of Chinese roulette. Regulars at Ru Lai claim you're just as likely to get "bearable" egg rolls and "halfway decent" rangoons as you are tainted tofu or Sichuan salmonella. You've been warned.

## The Solo's Manual by Morgan Blackhand
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
INTRO
<br><br>
Think you've got what it takes to be a legendary solo, huh? Sure you do. Otherwise, why pick up this book? You're looking for respect. For fear. For a way to be on top. Maybe you heard someone quote me about winning battles with only a glance, before a single shot's been fired. Well fine, I'll let you in on a secret: it is possible, and you can do it too, but only if you got the guts to survive going to hell and back more times than you can count. Thousands of fights, millions of bullets, hundreds of gallons of blood (yours included) - that's what you have to look forward to. And you'll need a solid ripper - one you can trust, one you make a lifelong choombatta out of, one who tells you every week, "It's a miracle you ain't dead by now." At least, that's what he'll say if you're lucky.
<br><br>
Nowadays, every kid with big iron, a syn-leather coat and a micro-missile launcher thinks they're a hotshot solo. But you know what? Just because you killed a few goons with a smile on your lips don't make you one. Anyone can kill. I knew this rockerboy once who blew up a whole fucking platoon of corpotrash. Did that make him a solo? No, it made him dead.
<br><br>
So you still think you got what it takes to carve your name into solo history?
<br><br>
Good. Then this book's for you.

## Kibble and Scop
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
Kibble stared glumly at his glass of a seaweed-colored drink. A part of him hoped the bartender had poured a pint of rat poison by mistake. "I don't get it, choom...", he murmured gloomily. "At school, they said I had talent, a real knack for acting. Was it all a fucking lie, or what?"
<br><br>
"Dude, there are billions of people on this rock," Scop shrugged. "Can't work out for everyone."
<br><br>
Kibble flicked on his olfactory booster and gave his beverage a whiff. Smelled just like the wet mop in the bathroom - maybe worse. Then, not knowing why, he suddenly recalled the merc he talked to a week ago in a popular punk dive he liked to frequent. Well, okay, maybe "talked" is generous, but grievances were certainly aired. The merc swept the floor with him that night and threatened to put a bullet between his tonsils if he ever spilled her tequila again.
<br><br>
This is it, he thought. Rotgut and tequila. Unemployed losers and hotshit mercs. The latter with the world at their feet. It's people like Kibble who are just a theater set piece, who make up the backdrop against which the Sandevistan-boosted mercs of the world can shine bright as stars. Kibble decided then and there that he didn't want to be just a splotch in the background anymore.
<br><br>
"Why? Why doesn't it ever shake out for us?", he asked with sour grimace. "Why does this city only reward bloodthirsty, bulletcrazy punks while the rest of us normal saps without murderous tendencies have to huddle over our cheap glasses of green cockroach piss?"
<br><br>
Scop shrugged again. "I dunno, find a gun, buy an edgy jacket," he suggested indifferently with a note of sarcasm. "Shoot up some gang haunts. Have the punkiest time of your life for four and a half seconds."
<br><br>
"What the hell happened here?" Kibble continued his rant. "The world's all upside-down! There are billions just like you and me. Billions of do-nothings, cowards... No, not cowards - people who just want things to be normal! Safety. Life... Life, Scop!"
<br><br>
Scop had already opened his mouth, ready to list off another round of cynical retorts, but then stopped himself short and started a tangent of his own. ife..." he repeated slowly and ponderously. "What if I could sell the world... an alternate life? The same all those edgerunners feel, except where you won't ever die like they do."
<br><br>
Kibble snorted and spat out the cockroach piss he finally mustered the courage to taste. "Sorry to burst your bubble, choom, but somebody's way ahead of ya there. Ever heard of Bloody Bout IV? Or, like... a million other computer games?"
<br><br>
Scop cracked a roguish smile. "Is Bloody Bout IV or these 'million other games' designed to work on a hybrid braindance system? Y'know, the kind I made a breakthrough on just last week?"

## 1,000 Beats a Second
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan"> 
I couldn't believe my eyes. For a moment, I thought Jessica had changed them out for faulty Kiroshis while I was asleep. But no, that wouldn't have been like her. I blinked again. No change. There I saw them, clear as day, the open flaps of Jason's chrome skull. I saw the electronic brain that, up until now, had been hidden by perfect imitation syn-skin.
<br><br>
The son of FutureTech CEO, the boy of my damn dreams, Jason... He was an android. Shit...
<br><br>
I sat there stuck with a dumb expression on my face and Jason stared back with one of his own. I couldn't help but wonder now... were those beautiful eyes of his - the same that had pierced my soul - were they merely a mimicry controlled by some emo-algorithm? Had there never been anything real behind them all those times? ... Not once?
<br><br>
"Alex!...I-it's not what you think!" he pleaded with a strangely authentic note of panic in his voice. And I wanted to believe him. I really did.
<br><br>
"Hmph... Well, clearly it hasn't been," I replied in equal parts anxious and bitter. "Me and my rotten luck... The first and last guy I fall for and he turns out to be a goddamn motherboard on legs!"
<br><br>
"No, that's not--," Jason suddenly broke off and smiled awkwardly. "Wait, did you... did you say 'fall for?'"
<br><br>
My cardio implant began to beat more and more quickly. My face flushed. Had I been wrong? Could this body of bolts, wires, and plastic contain whatever is left of the real Jason Cadalez? If his father was able to design a synthetic heart for me, maybe he could do the same for his son's brain. The question is... why?

## Sayonara Station, by Luke Steelman
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan"> 
Wait a second, before we start - have you wondered how this book ended up in your hands? Where it came from, who delivered it?
<br><br>
Of course you haven't - nobody ever wonders about things like that. It's a shame, because the answer's quite interesting. I'd go as far as to say it's fucking fascinating.
<br><br>
Not so long ago, most shipments were made via sea on freighters. Cheap, quick and (relatively) safe. But during the Fourth Corporate War, some genius in Arasaka had an idea - to release automated, self-replicating mines controlled by an AI into the ocean. What could possibly go wrong? A lot, it turns out.
<br><br>
The AI had a single objective: "Destroy enemy vessels." Simple, right? NUSA/Militech ships would get blown out of the water, while the Arasaka/Free State ships would sail by untouched. Except for the AI's iron-clad logic - since there was a non-zero probability that a vessel waving a friendly flag might also have enemies on board, in the interest of optimization it would also be sunk. Of course, when the leadheads back at Arasaka HQ realized what they'd done, they rushed to update the software - only for the AI to reject it as a virus. And thus, because of a handful of individuals' complete lack of imagination and foresight, the history of maritime travel came to an end.
<br><br>
So let's come back to the question - how did you end up with this book? Unless you live in Chicago, where it was published, then surely not via the Net - since that was destroyed by Bartmoss. Maybe it was shipped by plane? But air freight is incredibly expensive, so most likely not. By car then? We can't rule it out. But if I had to bet on it, I'd say it came to your city via train.
<br><br>
Imagine that trains (that's right, the ones that go choo! choo!) have survived into the present-day? Just last year, 15,526 miles of new train tracks were put into use, including the underground tunnel connecting Tokyo with Shanghai. At top-speed, an armored train can complete the distance between the two cities in under five hours! Now that's something I had to experience for myself. Two days later I was in Tokyo, standing on the platform of Sayonara Station...

## In the Shade of an Apple Tree, by Virginia Granchester
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan"> 
My first memory isn't an image or a sound, but a smell. The smell of rotting apples - intense and dizzyingly sweet. I must've been around four. We were spending the summer at my grandparents' house. They had a small orchard with this old, huge apple tree by the fence. That year it grew so many apples that nobody even bothered to pick them. We just watched them fall to the ground, where they lay rotting.
<br><br>
It's hard to imagine now - a world where things used to grow out of the ground without our help, without bioengineering. Where an apple was something normal - a fruit whose shape and taste every child knew by instinct.
Where a normal person, like my granddad, could have more than he needed.
<br><br>
Sometimes I think back to that orchard and that sweet, drowsy smell. But all I taste is bitterness.

## The Chronicles of Titania: Book 1
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan"> 
"You haven't an idea what you're talking about," the green-haired woman snorted and mockingly smiled. "I've visited many worlds, each built on a lie. All. Although... this might be the first time I've seen its people so stubbornly close their eyes to it."
<br><br>
Visan felt a rage swell inside of him. "How dare this woman, an outsider to the utopia of Titania, so harshly criticize a system that has guaranteed the happiness of millions?" he thought to himself. "If anyone is blind here, it's you!," Visan finally erupted. "Titania knows no inequity, no scarcity! For the first time in human history, everyone belongs to the privileged class!"
The woman smiled softly with a mischievous twinkle in her amber eyes. "Is that so?" she asked. "And your work at this... cannery? Why are you unhappy there?"
<br><br>
Visan forced himself to remain calm and, in truth, he wasn't sure why the stranger's comments had made him so upset. Perhaps it wasn't the foreigner's fault she could not comprehend that humankind finally achieved the ideal society. Her home, as she described it, resembled a primitive world, one long tainted by the stain of feudalism. In a sense, she was like a child. Intelligent, yes, but ignorant and self-righteous to a fault.
<br><br>
"There must be a group within society responsible for this type of work," Visan explained. "Thankfully, due to the advancement of robotics, the means of production have become fully automized[sic] and shifted away from our hands. We now serve only in supervisory roles. So to answer your question, no, I'm not unhappy. The robots do my work for me. Wait... you do know what robots are, right?"
<br><br>
"Of course, I do. We have something similar, only made from clay and stone," the lime-haired woman replied, still with a smug tone in her voice. "Very well, your world has done away with work done by hand. But if that is the case... does that not mean workers such as yourself have lost their former value? Are you suggesting there are none who govern your progress from above your standing, who determine your responsibilities?"
<br><br>
No response. The woman's golden eyes flashed as she laughed at Visan's confused, flustered silence. "My apologies," the stranger's lips curled into an embarrassed smile. "Maybe you are an 'equal' member of this corpo...corporation...? But, of what I've seen here... nothing about it matches what you have described."

## Sex and Chrome
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
<hr class="cyberpunk-hr">
Waves of pleasure cascade over my body, filling every pore of my being like ocean water through hot sand. More... I want more! How long I waited to feel his breath on my neck, his hands wrapped around my waist, his fingers caressing my lips. Our bodies are entwined in a primal dance, moving faster and faster to the rhythm of the creaking bed-springs, our skin bathed in flickers of neon. I can't hear myself moaning, but I must be since my throat is dry. I can't feel what my hands are doing, but the blood under my fingernails means I'm digging into his back. He's no longer kissing me, but nibbling, biting, pulling himself toward me harder, his control over me untamed, animalistic. It's so hot in the room that even his chrome is overheating, the bedsheets clinging to our sweat-soaked bodies...
</div>

## Crimeblock
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan"> 
McCrane scanned the room with a deft Kiroshi sweep. This corpse was no different than the dozens he'd seen over the years. The dead man's eyes frozen in fear, his ligaments, wires and intestines strewn about the floor - none of it made any impact on McCrane anymore.

"I've lived too long," he thought. "And cops who don't die quick usually find themselves playing for the other side eventually."

"This case is as clear as a used napkin at Deputy Zhao's," he murmured to Junior Inspector Malinowski. "Cyberpsycho. Came in through the window. Victim let him inside, must've known each other. Prints are all over the glass."

"Holy shit..." Malinowski shook his head in disbelief. "How'd the fucker get all the way up to the eleventh floor?"

"See those grooves on the windowsill? Climbing spikes, implants kids these days are gettin' installed to pull stupid rooftop stunts, get cheap thrills..."

Malinowski made his way over to the window to examine the evidence his superior had so effortlessly pieced together. The veteran detective lit a cigarette and stared back into the corpse's lifeless eyes. Although McCrane had never seen this man before, he felt as if he had known him a long time. And still... he felt nothing for him. No pity, no compassion. This was only a body now, no longer a person.

Suddenly, Malinowski's unsteady voice woke McCrane from his thoughts. "Uh... boss? These prints on the outside of the window...? They... they belong to you."

McCrane let out a quick, punctuating chuckle. "Never much took you for a jokester, Malinowski," the detective said with an amused smirk as he rolled up his sleeves to expose his wrists. "And I wonder... just how would I get there without any climber's claws, hm?"

But before the junior inspector could respond, McCrane felt an uneasiness shoot up his spine. This room, this man, the smell of his blood... He felt compelled to walk over to the savaged victim and reach inside his pocket. A photo. His own face staring back at him.

Malinowski slowly drew his pistol. "I believed in you," the shaken proté
gé uttered with a pain in his voice. "All this time... I idolized a-a murderer.""I... I don't understand," muttered McCrane, scarcely loud enough to hear his own voice. Something else began to drown out his words, even his thoughts - a strange, primal force. "For the first time in my life... I don't understand."

And then-CRACK-a gunshot.

## Chrome Night Love
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan"> 
Chroman's mask glinted in the light of the setting sun, like a beacon in the dark of this rotten city. Lucille's heartbeat began to quicken. Her legs trembled beneath her, hot blood pumped through her veins in a way she didn't know it could.

He looked at her, his strong, masculine figure towering over the bloodied corporate corpse, which just a moment ago had violently tried to defile Lucille's virtue.

"What's the matter with me?" her mind raced. "Why him? Why me?" Hundreds of questions burned inside her brain. But, when she finally parted her lips to speak, only one question emerged: "Who are you really?"

Chroman took Lucille into his cold, metal hands. She flinched at the touch. "You know I can't tell you that. They'll find you, they'll rip my secret out you any way they can... and then kill you.

"I--I don't care about any of that! I love you... I love you!"

She couldn't feel his face, his real one, concealed under that veil of chrome, but she could have sworn she could hear a note of emotion in his deep voice.

"You love a dream. You don't know who hides under this mask."

"I don't care what you look like."

"What if I'm disfigured?"

"I'll pay for the operation."

"And if I'm an android?"

"It doesn't matter!"

"And if..." Then, suddenly, in one swift motion, Chroman removed the mask to reveal... the face of Damita de la Veli! "... if I'm a woman?"

Lucille stood there, dumbstruck. A tempest of emotion swirled in a frenzy throughout her being. But after a moment passed, the storm calmed and she smiled warmly, taking her savior's face into her hands. The proverbial clouds of her tumultuous mind began to part. Lucille was beginning to see clearly at last. "How many times does a woman need to say she loves you," Lucille smirked and whispered softly, "before you believe her?"

## Diary (117-121/77)
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
117/77<br> 
We have set sail. Only Hanako knows the true purpose of our visit to Night City. The question is what to do with A. Hellman. He has proven loyal beyond even my own expectations and deserves compensation. Perhaps he might be interested in the position of Director of the Kyoto Institute of Technology, sweeten the deal by letting him have his own handpicked team. Employees like him should be kept on a short leash without seeing it as such.
<br><br>
118/77<br>
Militech have outdone themselves. This is not just a port, but a fortress. But the atoll is of no interest to me - it is what lies in the depths. I know what they hide. We should pay a tribute - five shots for every one of ours that lies on the seabed. The only thing that restrains me from giving the order is mercy for the innocents working on the port - I will spare them the panic and anguish with our missiles.<br> 
So rest well, Ye Fallen. Ne'er again will Ye be awoken with a BANG!
<br><br>
119/77<br> 
The further I am from home, the more my memories become sharpened, more acute. 
The faces of old enemies are suddenly thrown into relief. Even J.S. - I almost completely forgot about him.
<br><br>
120/77<br> 
Hanako thinks that she should be the one to have a word with Y, or at the very least accompany me. I declined. She took it in her usual dignified manner. Still, she asked what I intend to do. As of yet I have no answer to this question.
<br><br>
121/77<br> 
I see the coastline. Strange - in my memories the city seemed larger. If I wanted to, i could wipe it off the map in under ten minutes. I shared this thought with Hanako - she thinks I shouldn't do that. I usually defer to her opinion. But if the Relic somehow fell into the wrong hands, maybe it would be better to bury it among the ashes of NC? 
Until we talk to Y, I will hold off on a firm decision.

## Tamed Dragon: A Biography of Yorinobu Arasaka
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
In many ways, the story of Yorinobu Arasaka resembles an ancient parable. The younger son of one of the modern world's most powerful CEOs renounces his heritage, forfeits his birthright, and instead chooses a rough-and-tumble life on the streets of Tokyo only to later scamper back home to the warm, sheltered bosom of his family with his tail tucked. At least, that is the story most have pieced together from official sources. But why did Yorinobu betray his father in the first place? Why did he return? For several years, I dug deeper, followed leads, reached out to his former friends and acquaintances. Slowly, I began to unearth answers to some of the public's most burning questions.
<br><br>
Yorinobu was born in Tokyo in the early twenty-first century, the first child to Saburo Arasaka's third wife, Michiko. By all accounts, he seemed a happy child that grew to become a pleasant young man; that is, until his graduation from the University of Tokyo at the age of 21. Following the ceremony, the Arasaka family threw a party in his honor. At some point in the evening, Saburo invited his son to his study for a private conversation. What transpired there is wholly unknown, but after corroborating varied accounts, it is clear Yorinobu must have slipped out of from the party and the estate only a few hours later. Gone. A whisper in the night.
<br><br>
Over the next few years, various eyewitnesses spotted Yorinobu in the company of a nomad group known as Kotetsu no Ryu, or the "Steel Dragons." As part of this youthful rebellion, he purposefully involved himself in altercations with Arasaka agents and promoted anti-corporate slogans. After his family eventually confirmed Yorinobu's involvement, Saburo renounced his son and Kei, Saburo's eldest son, swore to exact revenge on his younger brother. Ironically, it was later at Kei's funeral that Yorinobu at last reconciled with his father. Stubbornly proud to a fault, many were suprised[sic] by the Arasaka patriarch's conciliatory approach. What caused Saburo to change his mind? What role might have Yorinobu's sister, Hanako, played in their peaceable reunion? That much yet remains to be discovered...
</div>

## The Flowers of Silence. A biography of Hanako Arasaka.
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
If I had written this biography on the basis of publicly available material, there would be two sides of this story, not to mention the foreword, afterword, and the acknowledgments.
<br><br>
Everyone knows that Hanako Arasaka is a very private individual. Everyone has heard about the tragic death of the last reporter who attempted to pen her life's story. Ten shots to the back. Suicide, according to the police.
<br><br>
That's why when my publisher asked me to write this book, I had to politely decline. Then when I saw the advance they were offering me, I started to reconsider. And finally, when I discovered that Arasaka's PR department had given its stamp of approval to interview numerous members of Hanako's entourage, I was on the next flight to Tokyo.
<br><br>
Soon enough, however, I lost my original enthusiasm. The people Arasaka sent me to be interviewed repeated the same answers to all questions - clearly memorized by heart. After a month's worth of research all I had was:
<br><br>
Hanako Arasaka is the daughter of Saburo Arasaka from his third wife, Michiko. She was born in 1999 in Tokyo and has only left the city five times in her life. Living a cloistered lifestyle, she never fulfilled any important role in the family business. She is very close to Yorinobu Arasaka, the black sheep in the family.
<br><br>
I was ready to give up when in the archives of a local T.V. station I found a recording of the opening of an Arasaka branch in Fukuoka, graced by the presence of none other than Hanako herself. She played the piano. Debussy's "Reverie." Why that piece? Why play a dreamy, introspective song while surrounded by stoic Japanese businessmen? Her golden fingers caressed the keys. I was mesmerized. Tears rolled down my cheeks as I listened. That's when I knew I had to finish this book. I had to meet this enigmatic woman and find out who Hanako Arasaka really was.

## California After Dusk: The Life of Richard Night
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
Richard Night was a pessimist. Even in the late Eighties, when the economy seemed headed for endless growth and the nuclear threat for the ash heap of history, Night saw the United States as hurtling toward collapse.
<br><br>
Richard Night was an optimist. He deeply believed the world could be changed for the better – and that he was the one to do it.
<br><br>
Richard Night was a realist. Aware he couldn't change the face of the world all at once, he decided to start small (for him, at least) by constructing the ideal city. His utopian metropolis was to be called Coronado City. It would stand as a metaphorical city on a hill, a shining example to the rest of the world.
<br><br>
Richard Night was doomed to fail. Not because his vision was inherently impossible to realize, but because many important, powerful people wished to make it so.
<br><br>
Richard Night was murdered. The city whose foundations he laid was finished after his death – but his utopian dream soon became a dystopian nightmare. Even the original name was lost. In honor of the city's tragically deceased founder, Coronado City was rechristened "Night City." Ironically, the name fits. If anything, the city is a cat; sleepy during the day, it comes frantically alive at night. And it loves to toy with its prey.

## Who is Dr. Paradox?
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
Who is Doc Paradox? Who's hiding behind the distorted mask?
<br><br>
Unsurprisingly, Doc Paradox won't say. After all, he's breaking the law - he has to protect his identity. If he revealed even the tiniest sliver about himself, NetWatch agents would be at his door in less than a minute.
<br><br>
But think about it. THINK. What kind of person could successfully hide from the world's most powerful corporations for years? Who could hack into encrypted T.V. channels? Who would disclose highly classified corporate secrets?
<br><br>
The answer's obvious. Doc Paradox is one of them. He's a puppet controlled by the establishment. To what end? Maybe this is how corporations funnel our anger and frustration in a safe and controlled manner, through a rebel who will never go so far as to issue a call to arms. Maybe he's being used to reveal "facts" that hurt the competition. Or maybe he's just a branding opportunity? In a month or two, Avante could put out a new, "Doc Paradox" line for us to wear our disapproval?
<br><br>
Only time will tell. But for christ's sake, don't listen to a word out of this phoney's mouth.

## Stop complaining - Get rich today! by Josh Kavorkin
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
The first and most important lesson: you, and only you, are responsible for your situation in life. Don't wait for the government to take pity on you, don't wait for your loved ones to lend a helping hand - just pull yourself up by your bootstraps and get to work! I know what you're going to say - unemployment is at 34%. But so what? What's stopping you from starting your own business? It's that damn simple! What's that? You say you need an education? So educate yourself, for chrissakes! From now on, I don't want to hear any excuses. What matters is that you can be rich too - but you have to WANT it! And for that, you have to WORK for it!

## Cyberware Usage and Its Side Effects
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
Many people believe we live in a time when "impossible" has become an obsolete term. Ripperdocs can replace nearly any part of the human body with artificial implants, from your big toe to portions of the nervous system. My years in Trauma Team, however, taught me that the "impossible" is still very much possible. Even now, as we enter the twilight of the twenty-first century, we as medical professionals have not been able to eliminate all of the side effects that come from incorporating cybernetic elements into our bodies. Of course, everyone is familiar with the mental disorder most commonly referred to as cyberpsychosis. But it doesn't end there. Although advances in medical science for the greater part of a century have reduced its incidence to a minimum, cyberware rejection can still occur in a small subset of the population. These unlucky few can experience a range of complications, but the following are the most prevalent:
<br><br>
1. Immune Response – The body rejects the implant, causing scar tissue to continue growing to the point that it causes pain and inflammation of surrounding tissue as well as possible interference with the tech's electrical circuits.
<br><br>
2. Psychological Effects – Neurological implants have the potential to cause unpredictable change in the brain. Possible side effects include depression, apathy, hallucinations and sudden increases in addictive behaviors, such as gambling.
<br><br>
3. Implant Overdependence – Long-term use of certain synthetic body part replacements can change the brain's chemistry to make it accustomed to a particular type of implant. There are reported cases of permanent blindness after patients attempted to replace their Kiroshi optical implants with different models.
<br><br>
In the face of these known risks, what should our outlook be as consumers and medical professionals? To deny ourselves cybernetic enhancements on the 0.5 percent chance we could lose our vision forever? Or gamble away our life savings at the casino? The clear answer is "No." Cyberware technology has elevated human biology to the point where these what-if arguments serve against our best interests. The best advice I can offer for minimizing your risk is to read the technomedical profiles for all cyberware you intend to purchase before you install it.

## Pain Editors and Mortality Rates
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
Introduction
<br><br>
The implant known widely as the "pain editor" is cyberware that reduces or even entirely eliminates pain. It has enjoyed unwavering popularity for years among certain circles in Night City, the most devoted, and arguably most valuable, of which is mercenaries. It is using this test group that Zetatech conducted the following research.
<br><br>
The pain editor is a neural coprocessor that inhibits the signals sent from nociceptors to the parietal lobe of the brain, thus preventing feelings of pain in the user. (Note: Some models also reduce symptoms of fatigue.) The beneficial effects caused by the pain editor are in some ways similar to the symptoms of hypoesthesia, including greater resistance to physical forms of torture and the ability to ignore pain from severe wounds which can allow the user to continue perform beyond normal human limitations for a brief period.
<br><br>
However, some studies have reported that the pain editor can yield a range of undesirable side effects. For example, in the heat of battle, some users are unaware of the severity of their wounds, which causes them to continue fighting without realizing they are dying and require immediate medical attention. The statistics support the theory that a lack of negative reinforcement may cause users to continue fighting when the rational strategy would be to retreat and escape death. Since 2020, the mortality rate of pain editor owners is above 60 percent.
<br><br>
In this report, I address the question of how to better protect Zetatech clients from avoidable death while using our pain editors[...]

## Relive.it - Braindance Quarterly
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
GUEST EDITORIAL
<br><br>
Braindance editors have long strived to strike a balance between real, lived experience and technological, experiential purity. The more heavily processed the material, the more abstracted the pathways, the clearer the braindance recording; these fundamental elements of design have guided editors since the first wave of brain-to-brain experience sharing technology took hold. In their pursuit of balance, however, editors have clearly shown a bias for purity over naturalism over the years, even going so far to use it as a point of pride in the quality of their production.
<br><br>
But in the industry's latest push for greater purity has the purpose of the technology already been forgotten? Will we not find ourselves processing and filtering a braindance recording to the point that the emotional experience no longer extends beyond what we receive from film, television and video games? After reliving some of the latest titles on my feeder unit, this once-academic question now feels all too inevitable with the industry's current trajectory.
<br><br>
For a moment, let's consider why some reports suggest more and more users are searching for unlicensed titles on the black market (so-called black braindances, extreme braindances, or XBDs). Are we so sure it's the illicit content they are after? Or maybe the real draw is the residual "grit" we editors try so hard to remove? Distracting thoughts, irrelevant memories, loose associative threads, emotions stretching beyond the desired spectrum... What if this "noise" is not so superfluous as we believe it to be? What if these peripheral experiences hold the potential to elevate a good braindance to an exquisite one? We do ourselves a disservice by not exploring these questions before our blind crusade for braindance purity leads this industry straight into the bin of obsolete, flash-in-the-pan technology.

## Can cyberpsychosis be cured?
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
Can cyberpsychosis be cured? Opinions on that question are divided. Only a few years ago so-called braindance therapy was used across the entire country on a mass scale with the aim of bringing the sick back from the point of no return. The patient would be placed on a special chair and connected to a device that would deactivate all implants. 
Then electrodes would be attached, inducing the patient into a coma-like braindance session. This was then followed up by medicine, psychosurgery and the aversion therapy. 
The overall treatment was intended to sever all the patient's neural connections and tie them back together so that the cyberpsycho could return to society. Once the therapy was concluded, no symptoms of cyberpsychosis were detected, as well as the patient's former personality. But don't worry - nowadays other methods are used. At least, that's what they tell us.

## 75 Years of Cyberware, by Tsutomu Takahashi
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
INTRODUCTION
<br><br>
A century ago, losing a limb meant tragedy. It meant living with permanent disability, with severely reduced physical capability, and often with a chronic pain. What's more, people with disabilities frequently suffered from widespread discrimination, both active (e.g. employment bias) and passive or unconscious (e.g. poor infrastructural inaccessibility). Today, assuming the dismemberment victim is financially stable, loss of limb amounts to little more than a minor inconvenience.
<br><br>
A century ago, employers could impose specific dress codes, hairstyle regulations, and piercing and tattoo bans. Many even pressed their employees to maximize productivity often in violation of the law, such as through anti-pregnancy policies. At the time, however, deeper involvement with employees' bodies was simply impossible, legal or otherwise. But, with the advent of cyberware, employers in the second half of the twenty-first century have imposed requirements for skin, bone, muscle, organ and eye replacements in order to improve performance and workplace effectiveness In extreme cases, security sector employees are commonly urged to undergo so-called full body conversions, or full cyborgization.
<br><br>
Much has changed over the past seventy-five years from when cybernetic implants first hit the mass market. Many in the field of history of technology have argued cyberware is a positive force for progress, and many have argued the opposite. This book attempts to describe and contextualize the changes - for better or worse - that it has introduced to our professional and personal lives. How has cyberware led us to where we are today, and where is it taking us next?

## Chemicals: The Invisible Killer

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
We've long known that the AVs criss-crossing our skies are busy dumping harmful substances in the air, such as aluminum, carbon dioxide, sulphur trioxide and sulphuric acid. Studies have also revealed the presence of dead red blood cells and E coli., as well as sodium chloride (table salt).
<br><br>
Now, you don't need a degree in science to know the harm these substances can wreak on the body. We've found that sulphur compounds can lead to cancer, heart decease and other illnesses arising from a weakened or even damaged immune system. They can also lead to spontaneous dental hydroplosion and acute meningitis.

[...]But, besides all this, death is the great opportunity no longer to be I;—to him who uses it. During life the will of man is without freedom: his action takes place with necessity upon the basis of his unalterable character in the chain of motives. But every one remembers much that he has done, and on account of which he is by no means satisfied with himself. If now he were to go on living, he would go on acting in the same way, on account of the unalterable nature of his character. Accordingly he must cease to be what he is in order to be able to arise out of the germ of his nature as a new and different being.

## Beelzebub's Tales to His Grandson
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
Even before our arrival, many beings in Babylon had lost their minds over this subject, while many others were inching closer to the same fate. The "burning question" of the day, the question that wracked the brains of both "pitiful scientists" and normal beings of Babylon was this:"Do we have a soul or not?" There were all sorts of the most fantastic theories on this subject, with new ones appearing all the time, and each and every one of the "tempting hypotheses" had its supporters. Despite the overwhelming number and diversity of these beliefs, they were all based on one of two completely opposing premises. The first was called "atheism," while the other was "idealism" or "dualism." All duelistic[sic] hypothesis held the soul existed and, of course, that it was immortal and could suffer many things even after the death of the being. Meanwhile, the atheistic theories held the complete opposite view. In short, my boy, when we cam to Babylon, we came upon what could only be called "constructing the Tower of Babel."

## Homo Deus: Christianity and Cybermodification
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
"So God created man in his own image, in the image of God." So says the Book of Genesis. Religious components of cybernetic body modification believe the Christian God intended the same perfection for man as He Himself possesses. Suffering, disease, death - these exist in contradiction with divinity, but can be overcome with the aid of science and technology. So called "cybertheologists" interpret God's command to "subdue the earth" quite literally. By their account, any and all means that might enable man to reach a state closer to divinity are "good", both ethically and morally.
<br><br>
However, some in their Christian fold have voiced concern that such cybertheologists guilty of excessive hubris. For an immortal man would this become his own savior, rendering the existence of the one, true ascendant God superfluous. Only the soul should be immortal, while the human body - as a "temple of the Holy Spirit" - should be accepted as it is: mortal and destined for resurrection on Judgment Day.
<br><br>
"Eritis sicut dii," said the serpent to Eve: "You will be as Gods." Religious purists exhort their sisters and brothers in faith to resist this temptation of Satan, masked as the will of God. But cybertheologists have stood fast and supplemented their cause with the phrase "scientes bonum et malum". They call upon humanity to tap into the divine and cosciously interpret for themselves what is Good and what is Evil.

## The Unification War... for Gonks!
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
*The Unification War is the most recent armed conflict to take place in North America since the Collapse, lasting from January 2069 to June 2070.
<br><br>
*Although the Unification War is formally recognized as a war between the New United States of America (NUSA) and the governments of the Free States, most scholars also classify the conflict as a corporate war. It is well known that the NUSA was backed by Militech hardware, personnel and other resources, whereas the Free States received the significant yet tacit support of the Arasaka Corporation.
<br><br>
*The Unification War is also sometimes referred to as the Metal War or Metal Wars, in reference to the wide use of armored cavalry units (so-called "panzers").
<br><br>
*The bloodiest battle in the Unification War was the Battle of Ridgecrest. In just one day, at least 3,078 people were reported killed.
<br><br>
*North California and South California were on opposite sides of the war, allied with the Free States and the NUSA, respectively, while Night City maintained a position of neutrality.
<br><br>
*The Unification War ended when all parties signed the Treaty of Unification in Arvin, South California. Both sides claimed victory: the Free States emphasizing that they had preserved their independence, and the NUSA boasting that they were closer than ever to reunifying a divided American people.
<br><br>
*The end of the Unification War, however, was not an end to the conflict at large. The leading AI analytics software predicts another hot war will likely break out by 2080 (74% confidence).

In early August 2023, a single event would change the course of history. Although it fell against the bloody backdrop of the Fourth Corporate War, the global media still fed on the story for weeks. And could you blame them? A group of terrorists detonated a nuclear bomb, blowing Arasaka Tower to pieces. The terrorists' warning came too late – not all of the Tower's employees could be evacuated. The blast itself killed and wounded thousands, while countless others died from radiation sickness. How did the biggest terrorist attack in the 21st century happen? Who was behind this catastrophe? To find the answers, we'll need to first understand the context of that era.
<br><br>
The early 2020's was a period of unrest for Night City and anti-corporate sentiment was at an all-time high. In the epicenter of the city's lawlessness stood the Atlantis club. It was seen as an island of resistance against the powers that be, primarily megacorporations like Militech or Biotechnica – though a special place in hell was reserved for Arasaka, the Japanese arms-manufacturing zaibatsu that held the most influence over Night City. The kinds of people who frequented the Atlantis felt that corporations had hijacked the future and turned people into consumer-slaves and ironically, deprived of the two things capitalism loved most – freedom and choice. These people called themselves Edgerunners. They positioned themselves against the corporate world order – they declared their own freedom and opposition to the status quo. But deprived of any peaceful way to meaningfully change what they called "the System," they reached for more radical methods of self-expression. And these people were no strangers to violence.

## The Undoing: Fall of the First Net
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
Chapter I: The Apocalypse
<br><br>
His name was Rache Bartmoss. Everyone knows WHO destroyed the first Net. The real question is WHY. NetWatch branded him a criminal and outlaw. The media called him a madman. Is either label correct? You be the judge. Below is a previously unpublished letter which Bartmoss put out just before the release of R.A.B.I.D.S. Why has this document only now just emerged? Well... Someone out there did not want you, my dear readers, to ever lay eyes on it. All the more reason to take a deep dive into the information available to us.<br>
‐‐ Maria Jimenez

<br><br>
The first Net was supposed save[sic] us. It would serve as a platform for those without a voice. It would offer unlimited knowledge to those who hungered for it. It would bring a fractured humanity closer together than ever before in our history. But these hopes were hollow. False.
<br><br>
The Net spread its tendrils around the globe faster than anyone could have predicted. Before anyone could even consider the full range of consequences. This "information superhighway" turned out to be our path straight to hell. We were robbed of our privacy, deprived of our free will, stripped of our dignity.
<br><br>
It was supposed to save us, but now even the Net itself cannot be saved. It was molded by the corps, with sharp edges, spikes and traps at every corner. Think of the Net as a stream of water that flows gently into our minds... before freezing, swelling, and destroying us from the inside out. But remember this about ice – as hard as it may be, it's surprisingly brittle. One well-placed strike and it shatters into a million tiny pieces. Watch out today and you'll see just what I mean.

## Why Be Me?: Confessions of a Braindance Addict
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
PREFACE
<br><br>
Do you want to be you?
<br><br>
Seriously. Take a moment to let that question sink in. Do you feel at home in your skin? Do you like your job? Your friends, your family? When you look in the mirror, do you say to yourself "I'm the luckiest person alive," then hop in the leather-upholstered backseat of your chauffeured Rayfield?
<br><br>
If you answered "yes" to any of those questions, put down this book and stop wasting your valuable time. If you answered "no" to the above, I understand how you feel.
<br><br>
It used to be said, at the turn of the century, that the world belongs to the "one percent." Today, one thousandth of a percent is closer to the truth. And your chances of joining this group are even less than that. In this reality, I mean - where you are you. In a braindance, you can be anyone. A broker who manages a portfolio worth trillions. An elite soldier who blasts his enemies out of existence with a tech shotgun. A suave rockerboy whom the whole world lusts after...
<br><br>
Now, I ask you again: Of the millions upon millions of people in this world, do you want to be you? The answer for me was always "no." And so my story begins. [...]

## The MaxTac Way, by Mathias Maddox
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
FOREWORD TO THE SECOND EDITION
<br><br>
I was fortunate, after publishing the first edition of this book, to meet many people with fascinating stories. I spoke with people who lost loved ones at the hands of cyberpsyshos. I met the relatives of people whom I shot. Needless to say, not every conversation ended on good terms.
<br><br>
After some time, I learned what questions to expect from my readers. Have you ever been shot? (Yes, and I've lost count.) Who was the most difficult person to kill/arrest? (The 2063 Golden Springs Mall Killer - more titanium bone and synth-skin than man.) What causes cyberpsychosis? (I'll let you know when I find out!)
<br><br>
Then, at a book-signing in Heywood, I was asked a question I had never heard before: Is there anything that keeps me awake at night? After a moment's reflection, I realized the answer was yes. Perhaps most surprisingly, however, it was not nightmares of eviscerated cyberpsycho victims, nor the shrieks and cries of my squad mates as they burned alive. Cruel as it may sound, I grew used to that. It was just part of the job. No - what caused my heart to pound as I lie in bed late at night is the thought that one day I, too, could succumb to cyberpsychosis. The amount of cyberware I have incorporated into my body is substantial. Far more than most. I tried to drown the human parts of me that fear, that doubt. I am aware just how fragile my humanity is - that piece of myself deep within that makes me who I am. One poorly clipped neuron, one hormonal overdose, and that piece may disappear forever, leaving behind an automoton with only one desire: to kill. In truth, I forced my mind to race so I would not have to confront these thoughts. Today, I still struggle with these demons, but I have asked my wife to keep a loaded pistol in her bedside table. If I begin to scream or rant incoherently in the middle of the night, I instructed her to empty the entire clip between my eyes. At first she objected, but our love is strong.
<br><br>
It is thanks for my loving wife's promise that I have never slept as soundly as I do now.

## In the Shadows of Megabuildings
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
One could say we're living in stable times. The 4th Corporate War is ancient history, the Unification War is over and done with, and Night City is a free city - a jewel embedded between two Californias. Living here, you might have the impression that everything is OK in the world. But look around.
<br><br>
The world is not OK. Despite technological recession between 2020 and 2040 reducing global pollution levels, humanity is still facing monumental existential threats. Climate change has turned into climate disaster - its effects are irreversible and dangerously unpredictable. Hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts, floods - natural catastrophes are growing in strength and frequency across the continent, leveling entire regions. Access to clean water is becoming increasingly more scarce, as well as fertile land. Hunger and starvation still reaps a bloody, human harvest in Asia and Africa, where corporations had no interest in building vertical, hydroponic farms.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, advances in cybermodification have given rise to a new problem:<br> cyberpsychosis. And though we've been aware of cyberpsychosis for over half a century, and know that incidents of cyberpsychosis are inextricably linked to a person's level of implantation, we still do not know why some are more prone to carrying out violent attacks than others. Let's not also forget the more serious issue of mass inequality, record high crime rates (including in places like Night City) and social unrest linked to immigration in almost every corner of the world...
<br><br>
So I ask you again - look around. You see all of these problems in Night City already. Maybe you're standing in the shadow of a megabuilding and you think, "Night City is Night City - the rest of the world's problems don't affect me, right?"
<br><br>
Right?

## Arasaka Academy: Best of the Best, or Best for the Best?
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
Arasaka Academy emerged as the #1 ranked institute of secondary education in Night City for the fourth consecutive time according to the Night City Perspective's annual review. The periodical earns the lion's share of its advertising revenue from the academy's namesake corporation, though their editorial staff claim this financial cooperation does not influence their rankings.
<br><br>
The magazine's education experts claim Arasaka Academy's infrastructure has no equal in Night City. Bias or otherwise, we cannot argue them on this point. Lessons are primarily conducted via virtual reality or AI-generated lesson plans suited to a student group's specific needs. Public schools, meanwhile, can only dream... It comes as no surprise, then, that parents who are not gainfully employed at a megacorp are increasingly willing to incur a lifetime of debt for a chance to give their child a chance at the city's most prestigious education.
<br><br>
But there are many uncomfortable truths the Academy is struggling to keep silent. Academy administrators promote a culture of constructive competition among its pupils as a way to forge the world's next great corporate executives. A rat race by another name with a diploma at the finish line...
<br><br>
Night City Perspective factors placement in corporate leadership roles into their calculations, and with this criterion I take no issue. What they don't include, however, is the drop-out rate. The enormous pressures these students face inevitably translate to anxiety, depression and, for some, even suicide. These rates are especially high for students outside the Arasaka corporate family. Such is the dark side of Arasaka Academy's glowing reputation.

## Pathfinder: Half a Century of Silence
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
When, in the summer of 2020, NASA's Pathfinder mission set off for Jupiter, it was the buzz of every radio station, TV media outlet, and screamsheet. Stills of the crew were plastered on every type of commemorative merchandise imaginable: mugs, shirts, plates, bobbleheads, bumper stickers, the list goes on.
<br><br>
But, just a week later, the steady stream of information dried to a tickle. A month later, the world had all but forgotten about them. Three years later, and two years before their planned entry into Jupiter's orbit, a conflict now known as the Fourth Corporate War broke out.
<br><br>
Cape Canaveral was one of the first strategic sites razed to the ground - NASA's mission control center along with it. Pathfinder, in the vast reaches of space, had been cut off. When the opposing sides finally signed a truce three years later, Militech set its sights on reestablishing contact with the Pathfinder crew, but to no avail. Pathfinder's signal, it seemed, had been swallowed by the void of the Big Black.
<br><br>
To this day, it remains unknown whether the Pathfinder mission was a success. If the crew ever did reach Jupiter and its moons, we have received no word, no data, not a single lead to follow. Maybe they never stood a chance. Maybe, after a half-century of silence, they simply have nothing to say to us.

## Yōkai: Japanese Demons of Yesterday and Today
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
They make their homes on mountaintops, in rivers and oceans, on city streets and on every megabuilding floor with the number 4 in it, even in your washing machine or infovisor. Some appear in concrete places, while others simply haunt a specific person. They're there when you hear a strange noise in the middle of the desert. They're there when you feel like someone's watching you, although there's not a soul in sight. They're there when you glimpse something out of the corner of your eye, something nobody else seems to notice, but you were just at the ripperdoc's for your checkup!
<br><br>
The yōkai first appear in Japanese literature in the year 797. These mysterious beings, though closely linked to the invisible realm of the dead, have been alive in the Japanese consciousness from the very birth of animism. It's not that the Japanese believe in the yōkai. They simply know the yōkai exist.
<br><br>
[...] In addition to phantoms, ogres and other mysterious phenomena, the yōkai also include a group of shape-shifting demons called obake or bakemono. The bakemono are said to sometimes take the form of a faceless person, a one-eyed scarecrow or an animal.
<br><br>
[...]It's said that when a cat reaches a certain age, it becomes a bakeneko. These yōkai are able to walk on their two hind legs, speak and dance, assume human form or even devour their owners and take their place. The bakeneko sometimes visit people in their sleep, or even wake the dead – all they have to do is hop over a corpse to bring it suddenly back to life.
<br><br>
However, the demons are capable of much, much more. One should exercise extreme caution around a double tailed cat. This is a nekomata, a yōkai with shamanic and necromantic capabilities, able to place curses on people and control the dead. In its human form, a nekomata resembles an old woman, often one addicted to some substance or other and with an eerie, disturbing air about her.
<br><br>
However, let me assure American readers of this book; today, the most likely place you'll find a bakeneko is in the form of lucky Maneki-neko figurines. After all, real cats are an even rarer sight these days than your average yōkai.

## Water, Chrome and Blood - THE FOURTH CORPORATE WAR
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
(...) It is truly remarkable that the large-scale bloodshed of the Fourth Corporate War began first as a simple rivalry between two ocean exploitation corporations: CINO and OTEC. Both companies vied for the controlling stake of the failing IHA corporation. OTEC commissioned Militech to secure its business interests and perform certain "special operations." CINO, in turn, signed a cooperation agreement with the Arasaka Corporation with a similar aim. When circumstances at last called for both colossal and prideful security corporations to clash in open combat, the Fourth War had officially begun.
<br><br>
Yet, as is usually the case with corporate conflicts, the onset proved subtle: Arasaka disables a Militech transport, Militech (allegedly) eliminates a high-ranking official of an Arasaka client, both sides engage in frequent sabotage and data theft operations, netrunners from both sides infiltrate dataforts to sow confusion, gather intel and cause chaos in the stock markets. Though none would have thought it possible in those early months, the Arasaka-Militech conflict truly jeopardized the stability of the world economy, making the threat of complete economic collapse all too real. For this reason, NetWatch introducted[sic] a communications embargo on both corporations. This did little to slow the conflict's pace, however. While CINO and OTEC had unilaterally reached a settlement and reach an understanding through "peace talks," tension between Arasaka and Militech continued to rise. This separation from the ocean dispute marks the beginning of the Fourth War's second phase: the so-called Shadow War.
<br><br>
Military clashes between Militech and Arasaka were notoriously bloody, brutal and without mercy, they waged their most damaging campaigns on the Net. Arasaka and Militech netrunners launched attacks with the help of viruses that were often highly experimental. What's more, they created lethal ICE measures and AI-like programs that could lurk in dark corners of the Net for long periods to make strikes at the most opportune times. 
<br><br>
By the second half of 2022, Arasaka and Militech entered the final phase of the conflict where both sides used every resource and strategy at their disposal. The Hot War had begun. Around this time, the Net that the world had known for years ceased to exist, and mercenaries hired by both corporations were slaughtered in open warfare fought with the cutting-edge weapons technology. Then, in the War's most shocking and iconic turning point, the coup de grâce came when an unknown group of mercenaries denoted a nuclear device at Arasaka's Night City headquarters. Shortly after the blast, bowing under increased pressure from the Japanese government, Arasaka laid down its arms and withdrew from many of its strategic positions, but most notably in Night City. Victory belonged to Militech, but it came at a heavy cost. (...)

## Lat-Am Wars
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
As a direct result of the armed conflicts on U.S. soil from the early 1990s until the early 2000s, Latin America (comprising South and Central America) remodeled itself into a strong federation of independent nations, bound through mutual aid and cooperation.
The U.S.'s military presence was forced from Latin American territories with the exception of Panama, where it stood its ground despite fierce pressure from guerilla forces.
<br><br>
Many researchers and contemporary historians maintain that, in fact, the Lat-Am Wars were responsible for the U.S.'s eventual collapse, breaking up the Gang of Four (CIA, FBI, DEA and NSA) and decimating the U.S. Army. However, it's important to bear in mind that no external conflict could have toppled the colossus of American imperialism were it not already built on clay foundations.

## Protein Farms: A Report
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
Protein farms are currently the source of most meat and meat-substitute products in Night City. Biotechnica is the clear industry leader, providing for over half of the city's demand for alternative protein. Currently, the most popular, albeit cost-intensive form of production is based on protein-rich crickets, which allow producers to achieve the highest-quality protein. Earthworms are available as a cheaper alternative, achieving a higher yield of product per square meter. However, worms pose a more difficult marketing challenge - while crickets have become acceptable, most consumers still bristle at being told to "go eat worms."

## Avian Extermination Act
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
The AEA was adopted by the Night City Council on May 04, 2063.
<br><br>
Purpose: In the face of increasingly frequent and deadly zoonotic disease outbreaks, the City Council has decided that the most effective method for reducing the risk of infection among residents is via the extermination of all avian life within 18 miles of city limits (See Fig.1)
<br><br>
The extermination process will begin on May 07, 2063 once the call and selection of tenders for the contract have been completed (See Annex 2).

## Outer Space! My Life in Orbit
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
What's life in space like? Comfortable.
<br><br>
Of course, not everything's a bed of roses. Gravity below 1g isn't great for your bones or muscles. Synthesized food isn't to die for, and stuff from Earth is as rare as it is expensive. If you live in a private orbital station (congrats, you're richer than me!), you always see the same faces. But if you live in a hybrid station like Crystal Palace, you'll have to live with corporat[sic] bachelor parties every weekend. But don't let that put you off! There are more upsides than downsides to living in orbit.
<br><br>
First of all: safety. To get into orbit you need a lot of zeroes in your bank account, which means you won't see legions of homeless people, skezzed out gangsters or aggressive joytoys (the exception to that being the Lunar colonies, but no self-respecting Orbital-dweller would ever set foot there). In other words - you can walk outside at night unarmed, without security, and come back home in one piece, wallet undisturbed. Amazing, right?
<br><br>
Secondly: quality of service. Anyone in the customer service sector had to rack up an enormous debt to come up here. Their only hope to pay it off within their lifetimes is to rake in a lot (and I mean A LOT) of tips, which means they'll bend over backwards to satisfy every whim. if you're an employer, you don't have to worry that an employee you just hired and trained at your expense will suddenly quit and go work for the competition for a few extra eddies a week. Many stations, especially the private ones, simply don't have competition, and if they do it's basically negligible - agreements can be made so situations like that don't occur.
<br><br>
Thirdly, and most importantly: no government can tell you what to do, where and how. Orbital stations are autonomous and governed by their own laws... and there aren't that many of them. If you can afford your own station, you're the undisputed lord and master of your little corner of space. You want to tie the help up to a whipping post when they make a mistake? Go right ahead. Want five wives or four husbands? I'm sure you'll have a line of willing volunteers.

## The Fall of Etemenanki

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
The Fall of Etemenanki<br> 
(manuscript found behind the Totentanz)
<br><br>
All ye mighty<br> 
look and despair<br> 
for here lived the City
<br><br>
in the far-off land of Shinear<br> 
where once was clay tamed and wrought
<br><br>
to build a temple among the narrow streets<br> 
where the howl of crazed prophets rose<br> 
from their skiff and the shadow of the ziggurat fell across the sands
<br><br>
Look and despair for here rose the Tower<br> 
strong as a tongue glazed in spit<br> 
held fast on the scaffolding of throats on the vocal cords
<br><br>
up which were pulled buckets of mortar<br> 
prayers fragments of code late cuneiform<br> 
on tablets plated with copper encrusted with tin
<br><br>
look and remember for here She fell and Her name was Babel<br>
[o Babel of dreams!] lest we be scattered over the face of the earth<br> 
ask the archeologists beyond the Totentanz
<br><br>
how she crumbled to dust the soft down of dialect<br> 
how the desert tore her how the sands of time ground her<br> 
until the word was ground fine and scattered among us
<br><br>
look and beware in the final hours of night<br> 
for the sun shall rise over the ruins and dawn shall once again melt<br> 
from the rubble the memory of the City its original source

## America: A Prophecy
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
The Terror answerd: I am Orc, wreath'd round the accursed tree: 
The times are ended; shadows pass, the morning gins to break; 
the fiery joy, that Urizen perverted to ten commands, 
What night he led the starry hosts thro' the wide wilderness, 
That stony law I stamp to dust; and scatter religion abroad 
To the four winds as a torn book, and none shall gather the leaves; 
But they shall rot on desert sands, and consume in bottomless deeps, 
To make the deserts blossom, and the deeps shrink to their fountains, 
And to renew the fiery joy, and burst the stony roof; 
That pale religious lechery, seeking Virginity, 
May find it in a harlot, and in coarse-clad honesty 
The undefil'd, tho' ravish'd in her cradle night and morn; 
For everything that lives is holy, life delights in life; 
Because the soul of sweet delight can never be defil'd. 
Fires enwrap the earthly globe, yet Man is not consum'd; 
Amidst the lustful fires he walks; his feet become like brass, 
His knees and thighs like silver, and his breast and head like gold.
