## EMERGENCY ON DEMAND
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
How did it happen? When and why did we as a society decide that human life is a commodity? A luxury?
<br><br>
My mother passed away at 45. She still had decades of life to live until it was all stolen from her by common pneumonia. If she had held even the cheapest Trauma Team policy, she could have been cured within an hour. But she couldn't afford it. My mother died five months before her scheduled appointment with our family practitioner...
<br><br>
The idea of privatized healthcare is deeply ingrained in our public psyche. Already in 2020, there was widespread consensus that 500 eurodollars a month was a fair price for Trauma Team insurance. Health wasn't something you were given, it was something you earned. The private system may not be perfect, but there's no alternative, we thought.
<br><br>
BULLSHIT.
<br><br>
Now cross the Pacific Ocean to the USSR where they also have highly trained medical technicians, high-precision nanosurgical suites, specialized antibodies, intravenous probes, the list goes on. Emergency airlifts using modern AVs equipped with cryotonic chambers? They have those, too. The difference, then? They don't leave their people to die on the streets, at the store, in their homes. They don't force anyone to purchase their lives from a corporation as if they're the ones who own it.
<br><br>
Public healthcare isn't some unachievable utopia. It is a REALITY.
<br><br>
Trauma Team, on the other hand, treats its policyholders as both potential patients to be treated and potential products to be bought. They save lives only because there is profit in it. A saved life is a returning customer. Client death can also bring in fiscal gains in the form of organ and implant resale, though of course in regulated, smaller sums. An emergency care provider can't afford to give its managers reasons to deliberately kill off its clientele base for short-term windfalls.
<br><br>
Surely, you ask, these medical "professionals" are also guided by their Hippocratic Oaths?
<br><br>
Please...

## NEW RELEASE BRAINDANCES
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
What's up, BD-maniacs? Hungry for a new emo-rush? Then check out the latest word from the freshest BDs on the market.
<br><br>
Foreign Body<br>
The body is everything. There is nothing else. It is you, but it is also just a tool for your mind to interact with the world. But what would happen if this tool tried to live its own life? What if it tried... to kill you?
Though not a particularly original addition to the thriller genre, this braindance featuring Luke Poller is still a solid experiential ride. The fear of disobedient implants has been around since pirates were walking around on peg legs – well, maybe not that long – as a result, the trope has been pervasive in film, braindance, and urban legend alike. Still, "Foreign Body" borrows some of the genre's best elements while still incorporating just enough new stuff to the mix to keep it interesting. After all, it's not every day you see the world from the perspective of a sentient arm.
<br><br>
Maxwell's Rehab<br>
This braindance season has been chock full of horror, but this one stands out from the rest. The always phenomenal Maxwell Ramirez is pushed to the brink of cyberpsychosis so we can relive his return to normalcy. The title offers a tone of optimism, but don't let that fool you. You will relive Maxwell's slip into psychosis, the heartbreak of his wife, and the gradual reintegration into a world that is now far different from how he left it. This BD is a must-relive of the season, but it's not for the faint of heart.
<br><br>
Badlands Raid<br>
At last, a BD for those looking for something a little lighter. "Badlands Raid" is a remake of the 2023 classic, which was an innovative tour de force of the time. For those of you unfamiliar, the plot revolves around an ordinary, boring guy who accidentally gets tangled up in a nomad ambush on a Zetatech convoy. I won't spoil it because, even though the main plot hasn't changed in 54 years, most people these days probably don't know the ending. What I will say is this: the remake's creators have introduced a few modern twists into the story that should make for a pleasant surprise to classics-lovers and newbies alike.

## THE RELIC – WHY ALL THE FUSS?
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
For years, experts in the field of cybernetics, neurology and psychology have been desperately trying to merge human consciousness with silicon. Until now, their efforts have been unsuccessful - though scientists have managed to create artificial intelligences that can compare, or indeed, surpass human intellect, copying the human "I" has remained beyond our capabilities. Attempts to do so have merely resulted in sophisticated chatbots - digital beings capable of mimicking human speech and mannerisms, but devoid of self-awareness.
<br><br>
Today, experts from Arasaka announced a breakthrough. Their newest project, dubbed the "Relic," allows human minds to be copied onto shards no larger than a credchip.
What's more, the shard can be slotted into one's neural port, allowing its user to "hear" and "see" digitized personality constructs.
<br><br>
Sadly, I haven't been able to personally examine the specifications of this remarkable piece of technology. Access to the Relic is heavily restricted by Arasaka, and only a small, select group of testers are allowed to participate in the program. Unsurprisingly, these testers are among the wealthiest and most influential people in the world - precisely the kinds of people Arasaka would like to have in its pocket. For the ordinary consumers reading this - don't expect the Relic to hit mass markets anytime soon.

## BIG 5 EMPLOYERS IN NIGHT CITY – 2077
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
It's that time of the year again we present our list of the biggest and best corps to work for in Night City! Who offers paid vacation? Who pays for employees' Trauma Team insurance policies? Who provides discounts for daycare and child bodyguard services? Have a look at our rankings below!
<br><br>
1. Arasaka – Coming in again this year in our #1 spot the Japanese zaibatsu juggernaut. Employees can expect to be fit with the latest in cyberware technology with a loyalty obligation of only 20 years!
<br><br>
2. Militech – The American arms giant provides its employees with up to 50% discounts on all Militech weapons. With a deal that good, you'd be able to put a Mk.31 Heavy Machine Gun under the Christmas tree for everyone in the family!
<br><br>
3. Biotechnica – Our 2077 bronze medal goes to Biotechnica who offers up to six (yes, six!) paid vacation days a year!

## HEALTHCARE AND TRAFFIC SAFETY – TRAUMA TEAM LEADS THE WAY
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
Second-rate equipment, under-trained medical "professionals", and high death rates – this is the best Night City's public emergency services have to offer. In addition to poor performance metrics, so too has their public image suffered. Scandals involving city EMTs colluding with scavengers have gone from rare to commonplace.
<br><br>
Recent cuts in municipal healthcare spending have led to the outright collapse of a medical system that already underperformed by most standards in the developed world. Ironically, this so-called "reform" resulted in a greater drain of doctors, nurses, paramedics and dispatchers from the public sector. Where quality healthcare was spotty before, now too is even calling the emergency hotline. Should you be among the lucky to reach a dispatcher, expect more than a half hour for an ambulance to arrive. And should you not bleed out before reaching the hospital, you're even less likely to find an available bed. Recent data show a survival rate for traffic accidents in Night City at a meager 17%.
<br><br>
For comparison, the average survival rate for traffic accidents across all Trauma Team policies is 91%. Response time is guaranteed to never exceed 3 minutes. Heaven on Earth? No. The minimum we all deserve. Something to keep in mind as you plan your personal budget... Purchase Trauma Team's Platinum-level coverage for the cost of Gold and safeguard your life today.

## LEFT JAB: BOXER'S MONTHLY
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
  
  Kazuo Kano – ronin from Osaka
  <br><br>
  Kazuo Kano's name is on the lips of everyone in the boxing world. The   up-and-coming light heavyweight remains undefeated after twenty professional fights, seventeen of which were won by technical knockout. 
  Some accuse Kano of doping, others say he has connections with the Yakuza.   While training in Night City, the light heavyweight was allegedly seen   "receiving" guests from Japan in his gym. Afterwards they were then seen being carried out of the gym unconscious. Wide scars have been visible near Kano's ribs for the last three fights. Local ripperdocs say that the scars definitely do not look like an appendix removal procedure... 
  Will Kano become the light heavyweight champion of the world? We'll see after Malone takes his revenge on Hernandez.

## THE MOX
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
  
  [...]It's one of those stories that is either very simple or very complicated, depending on who you ask. For Janice, it was a mix of both: "The Mox came to exist because it had to. We didn't have a soul in our corner, no one to make sure street justice was on our side. So we took matters into our own hands."
  <br><br>
  The Mox is composed of the people who, if any of them disappeared from the   streets tomorrow, you might never even notice: sex workers, ennyless artists, aimless rebels, and restless souls who weren't dealt a fair hand. Today, the Mox is thriving, as demonstrated by the booming biz of Lizzie's Bar. Lizzie's is renown for being arguably the best braindance club in Night City. Corporate suits, gangoons, pop stars, and locals alike all gather at Lizzie's to kick back, have a drink, and dip into the most beautifully scrolled and tuned BDs you've ever experienced. Most customers, however, are oblivious to the fact that the club is gang owned and operated, that the Mox are in charge, watching after their own. Just like the Lizzie of legend once did.
  <br><br>
  Know the story? "Lizzied used to work here back when it was just a typical dive   with a stripper pole," Janice proudly explained. "She took care of the girls, made sure eddies were falling into the pockets... and their teeth weren't falling to the curb. Like this one time, this fucker (Editor's note: referring to a Tyger Claws gang member) was having too much "fun" with one of the girls, and Lizzie just couldn't stomach it anymore. Story is she deprived the worm of his little Tyger balls so quick and nasty it took them two days to clean up all the blood and puke splatter. 'Course, the Claws found out fast and they flatlined her in a flash. But everyone that she had impacted in some way, they were still around. They came together, fought back and-- (pause) Well... you already know the rest."

## NC NIGHT LIFE – DRINKS, DANCING, DEBAUCHERY
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
  
  [...] If you're a dancehead like us, don't miss out on LIZZIE'S. You'll find no   better braindance club in the city, no matter how deep you dig. Modern boxes,   solid tech, but most important: the catalogue, chock-full of nearly any exp you   can imagine. You'll find everything you need to get you off - fast or slow,   nasty or classy, and everything in-between. Don't let the girls at the front   door scare you off or kill your buzz - they're wary of newcomers, but once you   get in they'll treat you like one of their own. Trust us, give LIZZIE'S a try   and you'll never go anywhere else. 
  
  Now, THE AFTERLIFE? That's a different story. Sure, you can cut loose and have   a good time here, but THE AFTERLIFE is a place of business above all else. Want   to meet with a fixer about a job that needs doing? Discuss important gig   details with a client over drinks? Or maybe just sit back and people watch, to   see the comings and goings of the NC underworld's biggest merc and fixer names?   THE AFTERLIFE is a great place for all of the above. The only place, really. 
  
  If you're looking for the city's marquee events, you'll find yourself at RIOT.   Chart-topping playlists, live performances from the brightest stars (both local   and from around the world), DJ battles, unique music shows, and media-packed   album premieres - sound like your scene? Don't miss out on RIOT. [...]

## HOW TO KEEP YOUR SHARDS AND DATA SAFE FROM PICKSOCKETS! [TOP 3 WAYS]
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
  
  Are you reading this on the street? In a store? In the metro? When was the last   time you checked your neural sockets?
  
  The picksocket plague is worse than it's ever been. The NCPD received hundreds   of complaints in their last cycle from residents who reported having shards   stolen from their neural sockets. How can you protect yourself? We've got you   covered!
  
  Thefts largely go uninvestigated due to the police's prioritization of violent   crime, which has left picksockets feeling increasingly bold. Exploits used to   hack our neuralware are widely available on the black market, so many thieves   have shifted focus from our pockets to our sockets. One brief moment of   inattention and your private information is flying from your neck into   someone's sticky fingers. The NCPD admits tracking such thieves is difficult   and a waste of resources, which is why we're here to help keep your info safe   with 3 options to suit any budget.
  
  1. Change your settings to ensure you receive notifications any time a shard is   removed from a neural port. Unfortunately, this approach leads to a high number   of false positives when you're fiddling with your own neuralware.
  2. Invest in new sockets. Several new models on the market already have   built-in safety and authorization measures to keep shards locked in tight. But   if you're pinching every enny, this solution could break the bank.
  3. Duct tape. Slap on a square of that and those shards aren't going anywhere.   On a budget? Bad with tech? No regard for style? Then this is the option for   you!

## A FAMILY OF EMPIRE
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
  
  The legacy of Arasaka needs no introduction. The Arasaka Corporation is one of   the world's most powerful, with offices located in every major metropolis   across the globe. For years, it has been behind the proverbial wheel of our   planet's economy and society. The history of Arasaka in Night City is deserving   of its own article, but suffice to say, the media industry in our city follows   the family behind the megacorp as closely as they do share prices.
  
  The story of the Arasaka family is one of empire – a true dynasty under the   rule of patriarch Saburo Arasaka. Rumors of the great Saburo's retirement and   cession of company control (as well as of its closely guarded secrets) to his   daughter, Hanako, and son, Yorinobu, have come and passed in recent years. But   has the time come where such rumors may finally contain a grain of truth?
  
  Our sources report that Yorinobu Arasaka is currently in Night City, but not   for a social call. And yet, if Yorinobu is strategizing a move for the throne,   what of Hanako? Experts who follow the family closely unanimously agree that –   due to "ideological" differences between Saburo and Yorinobu – Hanako will   likely cement herself as the one true heir to the immense fortune and power of   the Arasaka family. However, reality is hardly ever so predictable. Familial   power dynamics can shift in an instant. For example, what would happen if   Hanako fell from favor at a time when Yorinobu had his father's ear? And what   scenario might cause such a fall?
  
  No family is without its secrets, and the Arasakas are no exception. After   all... "What appears first as heaven, appears second as hell." – Japanese   proverb.

## THE VAMPIRE PRINCE IS BACK!
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
  
  Monster hunters beware!
  
  "Turbo Dracula" is a dark, gritty, visceral action game experience where you   play as the plasma-thirsty prince of puncture wounds himself – Dracula! He has   risen again, this time as a digi-clone in a body of chrome... but his appetite   for blood hasn't waned one bit. Assisted by the descendants of an ancient   bloodline, he wages war against the sinister HelsingCorp headed by the demon   brothers Manchester. They aim to take over the world with the help of   genetically spliced werewolf-zombies. Dracula must face difficult choices such   as whether to resurrect his old friend Viago or to transmutate into his nemeses!
  
  A polished real-time combat system and non-linear storyline offer the player   deep immersion in singleplayer, while the multiplayer mode allows you to team   up with your choombas as they take control of the brooding Varney or blonde fan   favorite Herbert. Without spoiling any of the endings (yes, multiple endings!),   I'll leave you with just one thing... Lady Carmilla Ruthven-Batory is hands   down the most captivating character ever written in the hundred-year history of   video games. Period.

## NO LIFE 3 - REVIEW
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
  
  After fifty long years, the wait is finally over! The third and final   installment of the No Life series will be available for purchase TOMORROW! As   has been reported already, gamers should not expect any major shakeups in   regard to the protagonist. We still play as strong-silent-type scientist Baron   Freimensch. We follow Baron as he ventures to the Arctic Circle to... Well, why   spoil it when you'll have your hands on it in less than 24 hours! The gist:   with Alice at Baron's side and trusty crowbar in hand, those nasty aliens are   in for a rude awakening.

## THE STRUGGLE OF O'NEILL STATION.
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
  
  The European Space Agency (ESA) started out with seemingly noble intentions:   "We'll open the door to the universe." "The Solar System - a home to all." And   so on an so forth.
  
  It didn't take long for these catchphrases to reveal themselves for what they   truly were - colonial ambitions wrapped up in lofty ideals. We, the builders   and first inhabitants of O'Neill 1 have witnessed this first-hand. The ESA sent   us into space with promises of a new life and a better tomorrow. Instead, what   lay in wait for us was a complete lack of freedom and back-breaking work in   extremely dangerous conditions.
  
  We would've pulled through, we would've toughed it out for the greater good -   if only they treated us as human beings, informed us of their decisions,   listened to our concerns and requests... But the ESA ignored us.
  
  The consequences were inevitable - in 2022, after completing construction of   the station, our situation was critical. Station management demanded eighteen   hours of work every day, seven days a week from everyone - regardless of age or   health condition. Our peaceful protest was met with a disproportionate use of   force, which included stun-guns. They thought it would break us, just like the   countless protests they broke back on Earth.
  
  The thing is, out here it's not so easy to call for reinforcements. Workers   outnumbered guards 40:1, and one stun-gun charge held only fifteen rounds. The   ESA's management had effectively shot themselves in the foot. It was over   before they could realize - only seven hours passed before O'Neill 1 and   O'Neill 2 declared independence and became the first nations established   outside of Earth...

## WHO IS LIZZY WIZZY PRETENDING TO BE?
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
  
  "We are who we pretend to be. I've pretended to be everything - that's why I've   found the truth."
  
  Lizzy Wizzy is an artist par excellence. Her work includes award-winning albums   and concert tours, film appearances as well as (for lack of a better term)   conceptual performance art. Her latest artistic obsession features the medium   of braindance. In recent interviews, Lizzy has mused about the boundary between   our documentation of reality versus our active shaping of it. Could that mean   Lizzy Wizzy plans to scroll her own BD? We can only dream! The chance to live   just one day in her chrome skin... Fans would go wild!

## WHAT REALLY HAPPENED IN ARASAKA TOWER?
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
  
  [...] If Militech was behind the assault on Arasaka Tower in 2023, and if   there's actual EVIDENCE to support that, then why didn't Arasaka return the   favor and nuke Militech?
  
  By now there's no doubt the bomb was manufactured by Militech, but that doesn't   mean they detonated it. I confess, I'm not a huge fan of the popular theory   that Johnny Silverhand, the controversial rockerboy, was behind the whole   thing. In fact, I'm not really a Silverhand fan, period. Silverhand was a poser   and a blowhard - not someone who would actually follow through on his grandiose   bluffs (full disclosure, I just don't think Silverhand would have the balls to   pull off something like that).
  
  Let's think this through - who hates corporations the most?
  
  Nomads, obviously. Remember that mass-market BD called "Badlands Raid" from the   20s about a band of nomads who attack a Militech convoy? Well, guess when it   premiered? That's right - on the night of the attack. Coincidence? I think not.
  
  Yes, yes, there's a Silverhand cameo in there somewhere, but that's just a   marketing ploy - a BD scrolled by a bunch of cactus-huggers wouldn't sell for   an enny without a recognizable face. But I'm more intrigued by the main actress   - how is it she didn't star in any other production despite "Badlands Raid's"   huge sales? Where was she during the attack?

## ARASAKA AND ORNITHOLOGY: THREE JAPANESE WORDS TO KNOW
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
  
  As conversations over factionalism within Arasaka heat up, many industry   insiders wonder about the company's future trajectory. If you struggle to   understand the complicated inner machinations of the world's largest arms   manufacturer, look no further than the obscure science of ornithology. Yes,   that's right; the study of birds can help. At least, in a sense. There are   three Japanese words every corporate player ought to be familiar with: kiji,   hato, and taka.
  
  Kiji - green pheasant. This bird has long held cultural and symbolic   significance in Japan. One can admire the world's last living specimens at   Hanako Arasaka's private preserve on the island of Shikoku. But the word "kiji"   also bears meaning among the factional identities within Arasaka. This group,   with Hanako at its center, consists primarily of conservative technocrats who   wish to follow the course set by Saburo Arasaka himself.
  In his daughter, Hanako, they see a guiding force to maintain the old order and   stability within the corporation..
  
  Hato - dove. The symbolism of the dove is recognized far and wide. The symbol   also aptly captures the character of the a much smaller faction within the   company led by Michiko Arasaka, daughter of the late Kei and niece to Hanako.*   This liberal wing of the corporation has unified those who seek deeper reforms.   Although they currently hold little influence, they enjoy growing support   popularity among some politicians and media personalities.
  
  Taka - hawk. As symbolic as the dove is, so, too, is the hawk. This faction,   headed by Yorinobu Arasaka, often prefers to take the most direct and   uncompromising solutions. Both stubborn and temperamental, he resembles Saburo   which has given him wide support among the more militant-minded Arasaka Corp.   elite. However, his more pro-Western inclinations and ideas that are innovative   as they are controversial have weakened his support from the Board's loyal   traditionalists.
  
  * You can learn more about Arasaka family genealogy from the eight-book series   "Two Centuries in the Clover's Shadow." Available in stores soon.

## STORM ON THE MARE CRISIUM
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
  
  By now we're all avid viewers of the reality TV show that is orbital politics. 
  Except this is real life, and what happens up there could have real   consequences for all of us down here. Recently everyone's been talking about   the attack on Ursula Correira, resulting in the complete loss of control in the   lower half of her body. The media has been endlessly replaying remarks made by   Correira's younger brother, Vagner, while also discussing the latest outfit   worn by Yara Ayoade to the official press conference where she denied rumors   that Correira's family had any hand in her "accident."
  
  I don't know about all of you, but with each passing day, the saying "What   happens in orbit, stays in orbit" is starting to sound like dangerously wishful   thinking.

## DR. HAVOC & RADON
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
  
  Introduction
  
  The Battery Sphere is in dire straits. The Irinians have occupied almost half   the city. Them and their technorat scourge have transformed almost everyone in   hordes of mindless zombies. Battery Arena is now the final point of resistance   against the invaders from Planet X. It seems the end if inevitable. That is...
  until the legendary mercenary pair arrive just in the nick of time after years   of mysterious absence!

## THE SOLO'S MANUAL BY MORGAN BLACKHAND
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
  
  INTRO
  
  Think you've got what it takes to be a legendary solo, huh? Sure you do.   Otherwise, why pick up this book? You're looking for respect. For fear. For a   way to be on top. Maybe you heard someone quote me about winning battles with   only a glance, before a single shot's been fired. Well fine, I'll let you in on   a secret: it is possible, and you can do it too, but only if you got the guts   to survive going to hell and back more times than you can count. Thousands of   fights, millions of bullets, hundreds of gallons of blood (yours included) -   that's what you have to look forward to. And you'll need a solid ripper - one   you can trust, one you make a lifelong choombatta out of, one who tells you   every week, "It's a miracle you ain't dead by now." At least, that's what he'll   say if you're lucky.
  
  Nowadays, every kid with big iron, a syn-leather coat and a micro-missile   launcher thinks they're a hotshot solo. But you know what? Just because you   killed a few goons with a smile on your lips don't make you one. Anyone can   kill. I knew this rockerboy once who blew up a whole fucking platoon of   corpotrash. Did that make him a solo? No, it made him dead.
  
  So you still think you got what it takes to carve your name into solo history?
  
  Good. Then this book's for you.

## KIBBLE AND SCOP
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
  
  Kibble stared glumly at his glass of a seaweed-colored drink. A part of him   hoped the bartender had poured a pint of rat poison by mistake. "I don't get   it, choom...", he murmured gloomily. "At school, they said I had talent, a real   knack for acting. Was it all a fucking lie, or what?"
  
  "Dude, there are billions of people on this rock," Scop shrugged. "Can't work   out for everyone."
  
  Kibble flicked on his olfactory booster and gave his beverage a whiff. Smelled   just like the wet mop in the bathroom - maybe worse. Then, not knowing why, he   suddenly recalled the merc he talked to a week ago in a popular punk dive he   liked to frequent. Well, okay, maybe "talked" is generous, but grievances were   certainly aired. The merc swept the floor with him that night and threatened to   put a bullet between his tonsils if he ever spilled her tequila again.
  
  This is it, he thought. Rotgut and tequila. Unemployed losers and hotshit   mercs. The latter with the world at their feet. It's people like Kibble who are   just a theater set piece, who make up the backdrop against which the   Sandevistan-boosted mercs of the world can shine bright as stars. Kibble   decided then and there that he didn't want to be just a splotch in the   background anymore.
  
  "Why? Why doesn't it ever shake out for us?", he asked with sour grimace. "Why   does this city only reward bloodthirsty, bulletcrazy punks while the rest of us   normal saps without murderous tendencies have to huddle over our cheap glasses   of green cockroach piss?"
  
  Scop shrugged again. "I dunno, find a gun, buy an edgy jacket," he suggested   indifferently with a note of sarcasm. "Shoot up some gang haunts. Have the   punkiest time of your life for four and a half seconds."
  
  "What the hell happened here?" Kibble continued his rant. "The world's all   upside-down! There are billions just like you and me. Billions of do-nothings,   cowards... No, not cowards - people who just want things to be normal! Safety.   Life... Life, Scop!"
  
  Scop had already opened his mouth, ready to list off another round of cynical   retorts, but then stopped himself short and started a tangent of his own. ife...  " he repeated slowly and ponderously. "What if I could sell the world... an   alternate life? The same all those edgerunners feel, except where you won't   ever die like they do."
  
  Kibble snorted and spat out the cockroach piss he finally mustered the courage   to taste. "Sorry to burst your bubble, choom, but somebody's way ahead of ya   there. Ever heard of Bloody Bout IV? Or, like... a million other computer games?  "
  
  Scop cracked a roguish smile. "Is Bloody Bout IV or these 'million other games'   designed to work on a hybrid braindance system? Y'know, the kind I made a   breakthrough on just last week?"

## 1,000 BEATS A SECOND
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan"> 
  
  I couldn't believe my eyes. For a moment, I thought Jessica had changed them   out for faulty Kiroshis while I was asleep. But no, that wouldn't have been   like her. I blinked again. No change. There I saw them, clear as day, the open   flaps of Jason's chrome skull. I saw the electronic brain that, up until now,   had been hidden by perfect imitation syn-skin.
  
  The son of FutureTech CEO, the boy of my damn dreams, Jason... He was an   android. Shit...
  
  I sat there stuck with a dumb expression on my face and Jason stared back with   one of his own. I couldn't help but wonder now... were those beautiful eyes of   his - the same that had pierced my soul - were they merely a mimicry controlled   by some emo-algorithm? Had there never been anything real behind them all those   times? ... Not once?
  
  "Alex!...I-it's not what you think!" he pleaded with a strangely authentic note   of panic in his voice. And I wanted to believe him. I really did.
  
  "Hmph... Well, clearly it hasn't been," I replied in equal parts anxious and   bitter. "Me and my rotten luck... The first and last guy I fall for and he   turns out to be a goddamn motherboard on legs!"
  
  "No, that's not--," Jason suddenly broke off and smiled awkwardly. "Wait, did   you... did you say 'fall for?'"
  
  My cardio implant began to beat more and more quickly. My face flushed. Had I   been wrong? Could this body of bolts, wires, and plastic contain whatever is   left of the real Jason Cadalez? If his father was able to design a synthetic   heart for me, maybe he could do the same for his son's brain. The question   is... why?

## SAYONARA STATION, BY LUKE STEELMAN
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan"> 
  
  Wait a second, before we start - have you wondered how this book ended up in   your hands? Where it came from, who delivered it?
  
  Of course you haven't - nobody ever wonders about things like that. It's a   shame, because the answer's quite interesting. I'd go as far as to say it's   fucking fascinating.
  
  Not so long ago, most shipments were made via sea on freighters. Cheap, quick   and (relatively) safe. But during the Fourth Corporate War, some genius in   Arasaka had an idea - to release automated, self-replicating mines controlled   by an AI into the ocean. What could possibly go wrong? A lot, it turns out.
  
  The AI had a single objective: "Destroy enemy vessels." Simple, right? NUSA/  Militech ships would get blown out of the water, while the Arasaka/Free State   ships would sail by untouched. Except for the AI's iron-clad logic - since   there was a non-zero probability that a vessel waving a friendly flag might   also have enemies on board, in the interest of optimization it would also be   sunk. Of course, when the leadheads back at Arasaka HQ realized what they'd   done, they rushed to update the software - only for the AI to reject it as a   virus. And thus, because of a handful of individuals' complete lack of   imagination and foresight, the history of maritime travel came to an end.
  
  So let's come back to the question - how did you end up with this book? Unless   you live in Chicago, where it was published, then surely not via the Net -   since that was destroyed by Bartmoss. Maybe it was shipped by plane? But air   freight is incredibly expensive, so most likely not. By car then? We can't rule   it out. But if I had to bet on it, I'd say it came to your city via train.
  
  Imagine that trains (that's right, the ones that go choo! choo!) have survived   into the present-day? Just last year, 15,526 miles of new train tracks were put   into use, including the underground tunnel connecting Tokyo with Shanghai. At   top-speed, an armored train can complete the distance between the two cities in   under five hours! Now that's something I had to experience for myself. Two days   later I was in Tokyo, standing on the platform of Sayonara Station...

## IN THE SHADE OF AN APPLE TREE, BY VIRGINIA GRANCHESTER
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan"> 
  
  My first memory isn't an image or a sound, but a smell. The smell of rotting   apples - intense and dizzyingly sweet. I must've been around four. We were   spending the summer at my grandparents' house. They had a small orchard with   this old, huge apple tree by the fence. That year it grew so many apples that   nobody even bothered to pick them. We just watched them fall to the ground,   where they lay rotting.
  
  It's hard to imagine now - a world where things used to grow out of the ground   without our help, without bioengineering. Where an apple was something normal -   a fruit whose shape and taste every child knew by instinct.
  Where a normal person, like my granddad, could have more than he needed.
  
  Sometimes I think back to that orchard and that sweet, drowsy smell. But all I   taste is bitterness.

  Clients from group "Storyteller"
  
  Client #1/2077, M.B., Scorpio 
  You did it again: you rolled up your sleeves and cleaned the Augean stables.   Everyone admires you, but you know that your only reward will be the next task   you're given. 
  There are not many like you in Night City, but without you the city would have   long turned into shadows and dust. 
  Avoid: flirty AIs that try to impress you with their knowledge of ancient Greek 
  Your lucky place: the Net
  
  Client #2/2077, D.K., Capricorn 
  You're a born corpo – you plot, you plan, you calculate, and weave webs so   tangled you sometimes lose yourself in them. If only you were the one calling   the shots, you would already have the city at your feet; unfortunately, you're   caught up in a maze of responsibilities. 
  But whatever you're plotting, make sure you see it through to the end. 
  Avoid: last-minute changes to plans 
  Your lucky place: Arasaka Tower
  
  Client #3/2077, D.B., Gemini 
  You know the city like the back of your hand. At night you head out to just   listen to the pulse of the streets – the juicy chatter, muffled screams, and   drunken shouts – just to soak up the atmosphere. You've been everywhere, you've   tried everything. You're a free spirit, and in Night City that makes you a   unicorn. 
  Avoid: overworking 
  Your lucky place: newsroom
  
  Client #4/2077, J.S., Taurus 
  You've done your time waiting in the shadows of others, but your patience   finally paid off. The applause and flash photography are all yours. The world   of media has opened its doors to you: television, radio, braindance, Net ...   And this is just the beginning. 
  Avoid: the waves crashing at your feet 
  Your lucky place: TV studio
  
  Client #5/2077, M.Z., Aries 
  When everyone was down and out, you came storming back in style. This city   loves people like you – it's how legends are born.
  Your triumph is bittersweet: you returned, but you've wound up on the street,   among the joytoys, con artists, and panhandlers. You know you've got biz here   to take care of, but it can get tough when it feels like there's no end to it   in sight. 
  Avoid: sketchy ripperdocs 
  Your lucky place: Jig-Jig Street
  
  Client #6/2077, T.M., Leo 
  This city likes to devour players like you, but you know their kind too well to   get caught off-guard. You're on the ground, you know that in Night City biz   only gets done when you put your blood, sweat and tears into it – not just   flimsy dreams. You eat dreamers for breakfast. 
  Avoid: genetically modified nuts 
  Your lucky place: Heywood
  
  Client #7/2077, R.W.O., Aries 
  You've been in demand. You barely finish one task before someone's lined up to   give you another. It often seems that you're on your own, but always remember   you have a team you can count on. 
  Avoid: emotional policemen with difficult pasts 
  Your lucky place: a bar inspired by Babylonian culture
  
  Client #8/2077, P.C., Capricorn 
  Although you've been riding with nomads for years, you're a corpo at heart. You   knew that from the moment you stepped into Konpeki Plaza you felt at home   there. You've had enough of camp life, constantly repairing generators, the   sand gritting between your teeth. You'd have given up ages ago if you weren't   so damn good at it. 
  Avoid: Raffen Shiv 
  Your lucky place: Konpeki Plaza 
  Note: highly susceptible to the Barnum effect
  
  Client #9/2077, K.K., Virgo 
  You've been in the city for only a short time, but you already know the what   and the how. You've already accomplished the toughest part: you have a good   team at your back. You've just been landing small jobs for now, but you know   you're hungry for something bigger. 
  Avoid: getting attached to friendly, talking machines 
  Your lucky place: the music scene

## DIARY (117-121/77)
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
  
  117/77 
  We have set sail. Only Hanako knows the true purpose of our visit to Night   City. The question is what to do with A. Hellman. He has proven loyal beyond   even my own expectations and deserves compensation. Perhaps he might be   interested in the position of Director of the Kyoto Institute of Technology,   sweeten the deal by letting him have his own handpicked team. Employees like   him should be kept on a short leash without seeing it as such.
  
  118/77 Militech have outdone themselves. This is not just a port, but a   fortress. But the atoll is of no interest to me - it is what lies in the   depths. I know what they hide. We should pay a tribute - five shots for every   one of ours that lies on the seabed. The only thing that restrains me from   giving the order is mercy for the innocents working on the port - I will spare   them the panic and anguish with our missiles. 
  So rest well, Ye Fallen. Ne'er again will Ye be awoken with a BANG!
  
  119/77 
  The further I am from home, the more my memories become sharpened, more acute. 
  The faces of old enemies are suddenly thrown into relief. Even J.S. - I almost   completely forgot about him.
  
  120/77 
  Hanako thinks that she should be the one to have a word with Y, or at the very   least accompany me. I declined. She took it in her usual dignified manner.   Still, she asked what I intend to do. As of yet I have no answer to this   question.
  
  121/77 
  I see the coastline. Strange - in my memories the city seemed larger. If I   wanted to, i could wipe it off the map in under ten minutes. I shared this   thought with Hanako - she thinks I shouldn't do that. I usually defer to her   opinion. But if the Relic somehow fell into the wrong hands, maybe it would be   better to bury it among the ashes of NC? 
  Until we talk to Y, I will hold off on a firm decision.

## TAMED DRAGON: A BIOGRAPHY OF YORINOBU ARASAKA
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
  
  In many ways, the story of Yorinobu Arasaka resembles an ancient parable. The   younger son of one of the modern world's most powerful CEOs renounces his   heritage, forfeits his birthright, and instead chooses a rough-and-tumble life   on the streets of Tokyo only to later scamper back home to the warm, sheltered   bosom of his family with his tail tucked. At least, that is the story most have   pieced together from official sources. But why did Yorinobu betray his father   in the first place? Why did he return? For several years, I dug deeper,   followed leads, reached out to his former friends and acquaintances. Slowly, I   began to unearth answers to some of the public's most burning questions.
  
  Yorinobu was born in Tokyo in the early twenty-first century, the first child   to Saburo Arasaka's third wife, Michiko. By all accounts, he seemed a happy   child that grew to become a pleasant young man; that is, until his graduation   from the University of Tokyo at the age of 21. Following the ceremony, the   Arasaka family threw a party in his honor. At some point in the evening, Saburo   invited his son to his study for a private conversation. What transpired there   is wholly unknown, but after corroborating varied accounts, it is clear   Yorinobu must have slipped out of from the party and the estate only a few   hours later. Gone. A whisper in the night.
  
  Over the next few years, various eyewitnesses spotted Yorinobu in the company   of a nomad group known as Kotetsu no Ryu, or the "Steel Dragons." As part of   this youthful rebellion, he purposefully involved himself in altercations with   Arasaka agents and promoted anti-corporate slogans. After his family eventually   confirmed Yorinobu's involvement, Saburo renounced his son and Kei, Saburo's   eldest son, swore to exact revenge on his younger brother. Ironically, it was   later at Kei's funeral that Yorinobu at last reconciled with his father.   Stubbornly proud to a fault, many were suprised(sic) by the Arasaka patriarch's   conciliatory approach. What caused Saburo to change his mind? What role might   have Yorinobu's sister, Hanako, played in their peaceable reunion? That much   yet remains to be discovered...
  
</div>

## THE FLOWERS OF SILENCE. A BIOGRAPHY OF HANAKO ARASAKA.
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
  
  If I had written this biography on the basis of publicly available material,   there would be two sides of this story, not to mention the foreword, afterword,   and the acknowledgments.
  
  Everyone knows that Hanako Arasaka is a very private individual. Everyone has   heard about the tragic death of the last reporter who attempted to pen her   life's story. Ten shots to the back. Suicide, according to the police.
  
  That's why when my publisher asked me to write this book, I had to politely   decline. Then when I saw the advance they were offering me, I started to   reconsider. And finally, when I discovered that Arasaka's PR department had   given its stamp of approval to interview numerous members of Hanako's   entourage, I was on the next flight to Tokyo.
  
  Soon enough, however, I lost my original enthusiasm. The people Arasaka sent me   to be interviewed repeated the same answers to all questions - clearly   memorized by heart. After a month's worth of research all I had was:
  
  Hanako Arasaka is the daughter of Saburo Arasaka from his third wife, Michiko.   She was born in 1999 in Tokyo and has only left the city five times in her   life. Living a cloistered lifestyle, she never fulfilled any important role in   the family business. She is very close to Yorinobu Arasaka, the black sheep in   the family.
  
  I was ready to give up when in the archives of a local T.V. station I found a   recording of the opening of an Arasaka branch in Fukuoka, graced by the   presence of none other than Hanako herself. She played the piano. Debussy's   "Reverie." Why that piece? Why play a dreamy, introspective song while   surrounded by stoic Japanese businessmen? Her golden fingers caressed the keys.   I was mesmerized. Tears rolled down my cheeks as I listened. That's when I knew   I had to finish this book. I had to meet this enigmatic woman and find out who   Hanako Arasaka really was.

## CALIFORNIA AFTER DUSK: THE LIFE OF RICHARD NIGHT
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
  
  Richard Night was a pessimist. Even in the late Eighties, when the economy   seemed headed for endless growth and the nuclear threat for the ash heap of   history, Night saw the United States as hurtling toward collapse.
  
  Richard Night was an optimist. He deeply believed the world could be changed   for the better – and that he was the one to do it.
  
  Richard Night was a realist. Aware he couldn't change the face of the world all   at once, he decided to start small (for him, at least) by constructing the   ideal city. His utopian metropolis was to be called Coronado City. It would   stand as a metaphorical city on a hill, a shining example to the rest of the   world.
  
  Richard Night was doomed to fail. Not because his vision was inherently   impossible to realize, but because many important, powerful people wished to   make it so.
  
  Richard Night was murdered. The city whose foundations he laid was finished   after his death – but his utopian dream soon became a dystopian nightmare. Even   the original name was lost. In honor of the city's tragically deceased founder,   Coronado City was rechristened "Night City." Ironically, the name fits. If   anything, the city is a cat; sleepy during the day, it comes frantically alive   at night. And it loves to toy with its prey.

{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
  
  Many people believe we live in a time when "impossible" has become an obsolete   term. Ripperdocs can replace nearly any part of the human body with artificial   implants, from your big toe to portions of the nervous system. My years in   Trauma Team, however, taught me that the "impossible" is still very much   possible. Even now, as we enter the twilight of the twenty-first century, we as   medical professionals have not been able to eliminate all of the side effects   that come from incorporating cybernetic elements into our bodies. Of course,   everyone is familiar with the mental disorder most commonly referred to as   cyberpsychosis. But it doesn't end there. Although advances in medical science   for the greater part of a century have reduced its incidence to a minimum,   cyberware rejection can still occur in a small subset of the population. These   unlucky few can experience a range of complications, but the following are the   most prevalent:
  
  1. Immune Response – The body rejects the implant, causing scar tissue to   continue growing to the point that it causes pain and inflammation of   surrounding tissue as well as possible interference with the tech's electrical   circuits.
  
  2. Psychological Effects – Neurological implants have the potential to cause   unpredictable change in the brain. Possible side effects include depression,   apathy, hallucinations and sudden increases in addictive behaviors, such as   gambling.
  
  3. Implant Overdependence – Long-term use of certain synthetic body part   replacements can change the brain's chemistry to make it accustomed to a   particular type of implant. There are reported cases of permanent blindness   after patients attempted to replace their Kiroshi optical implants with   different models.
  
  In the face of these known risks, what should our outlook be as consumers and   medical professionals? To deny ourselves cybernetic enhancements on the 0.5   percent chance we could lose our vision forever? Or gamble away our life   savings at the casino? The clear answer is "No." Cyberware technology has   elevated human biology to the point where these what-if arguments serve against   our best interests. The best advice I can offer for minimizing your risk is to   read the technomedical profiles for all cyberware you intend to purchase before   you install it.

## PAIN EDITORS AND MORTALITY RATES
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
  
  Introduction
  
  The implant known widely as the "pain editor" is cyberware that reduces or even   entirely eliminates pain. It has enjoyed unwavering popularity for years among   certain circles in Night City, the most devoted, and arguably most valuable, of   which is mercenaries. It is using this test group that Zetatech conducted the   following research.
  
  The pain editor is a neural coprocessor that inhibits the signals sent from   nociceptors to the parietal lobe of the brain, thus preventing feelings of pain   in the user. (Note: Some models also reduce symptoms of fatigue.) The   beneficial effects caused by the pain editor are in some ways similar to the   symptoms of hypoesthesia, including greater resistance to physical forms of   torture and the ability to ignore pain from severe wounds which can allow the   user to continue perform beyond normal human limitations for a brief period.
  
  However, some studies have reported that the pain editor can yield a range of   undesirable side effects. For example, in the heat of battle, some users are   unaware of the severity of their wounds, which causes them to continue fighting   without realizing they are dying and require immediate medical attention. The   statistics support the theory that a lack of negative reinforcement may cause   users to continue fighting when the rational strategy would be to retreat and   escape death. Since 2020, the mortality rate of pain editor owners is above 60   percent.
  
  In this report, I address the question of how to better protect Zetatech   clients from avoidable death while using our pain editors[...]

## RELIVE.IT - BRAINDANCE QUARTERLY
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
  
  GUEST EDITORIAL
  
  Braindance editors have long strived to strike a balance between real, lived   experience and technological, experiential purity. The more heavily processed   the material, the more abstracted the pathways, the clearer the braindance   recording; these fundamental elements of design have guided editors since the   first wave of brain-to-brain experience sharing technology took hold. In their   pursuit of balance, however, editors have clearly shown a bias for purity over   naturalism over the years, even going so far to use it as a point of pride in   the quality of their production.
  
  But in the industry's latest push for greater purity has the purpose of the   technology already been forgotten? Will we not find ourselves processing and   filtering a braindance recording to the point that the emotional experience no   longer extends beyond what we receive from film, television and video games?   After reliving some of the latest titles on my feeder unit, this once-academic   question now feels all too inevitable with the industry's current trajectory.
  
  For a moment, let's consider why some reports suggest more and more users are   searching for unlicensed titles on the black market (so-called black   braindances, extreme braindances, or XBDs). Are we so sure it's the illicit   content they are after? Or maybe the real draw is the residual "grit" we   editors try so hard to remove? Distracting thoughts, irrelevant memories, loose   associative threads, emotions stretching beyond the desired spectrum... What if   this "noise" is not so superfluous as we believe it to be? What if these   peripheral experiences hold the potential to elevate a good braindance to an   exquisite one? We do ourselves a disservice by not exploring these questions   before our blind crusade for braindance purity leads this industry straight   into the bin of obsolete, flash-in-the-pan technology.

## CAN CYBERPSYCHOSIS BE CURED?
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
  
  Can cyberpsychosis be cured? Opinions on that question are divided. Only a few   years ago so-called braindance therapy was used across the entire country on a   mass scale with the aim of bringing the sick back from the point of no return.   The patient would be placed on a special chair and connected to a device that   would deactivate all implants. 
  Then electrodes would be attached, inducing the patient into a coma-like   braindance session. This was then followed up by medicine, psychosurgery and   the aversion therapy. 
  The overall treatment was intended to sever all the patient's neural   connections and tie them back together so that the cyberpsycho could return to   society. Once the therapy was concluded, no symptoms of cyberpsychosis were   detected, as well as the patient's former personality. But don't worry -   nowadays other methods are used. At least, that's what they tell us.

## 75 YEARS OF CYBERWARE, BY TSUTOMU TAKAHASHI
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
  
  INTRODUCTION
  
  A century ago, losing a limb meant tragedy. It meant living with permanent   disability, with severely reduced physical capability, and often with a chronic   pain. What's more, people with disabilities frequently suffered from widespread   discrimination, both active (e.g. employment bias) and passive or unconscious   (e.g. poor infrastructural inaccessibility). Today, assuming the dismemberment   victim is financially stable, loss of limb amounts to little more than a minor   inconvenience.
  
  A century ago, employers could impose specific dress codes, hairstyle   regulations, and piercing and tattoo bans. Many even pressed their employees to   maximize productivity often in violation of the law, such as through   anti-pregnancy policies. At the time, however, deeper involvement with   employees' bodies was simply impossible, legal or otherwise. But, with the   advent of cyberware, employers in the second half of the twenty-first century   have imposed requirements for skin, bone, muscle, organ and eye replacements in   order to improve performance and workplace effectiveness In extreme cases,   security sector employees are commonly urged to undergo so-called full body   conversions, or full cyborgization.
  
  Much has changed over the past seventy-five years from when cybernetic implants   first hit the mass market. Many in the field of history of technology have   argued cyberware is a positive force for progress, and many have argued the   opposite. This book attempts to describe and contextualize the changes - for   better or worse - that it has introduced to our professional and personal   lives. How has cyberware led us to where we are today, and where is it taking   us next?

## CHEMICALS: THE INVISIBLE KILLER
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
  
  We've long known that the AVs criss-crossing our skies are busy dumping harmful   substances in the air, such as aluminum, carbon dioxide, sulphur trioxide and   sulphuric acid. Studies have also revealed the presence of dead red blood cells   and E coli., as well as sodium chloride (table salt).
  
  Now, you don't need a degree in science to know the harm these substances can   wreak on the body. We've found that sulphur compounds can lead to cancer, heart   decease and other illnesses arising from a weakened or even damaged immune   system. They can also lead to spontaneous dental hydroplosion and acute   meningitis.

  [...]But, besides all this, death is the great opportunity no longer to be I;  —to him who uses it. During life the will of man is without freedom: his action   takes place with necessity upon the basis of his unalterable character in the   chain of motives. But every one remembers much that he has done, and on account   of which he is by no means satisfied with himself. If now he were to go on   living, he would go on acting in the same way, on account of the unalterable   nature of his character. Accordingly he must cease to be what he is in order to   be able to arise out of the germ of his nature as a new and different being.

## BEELZEBUB'S TALES TO HIS GRANDSON
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
  
  Even before our arrival, many beings in Babylon had lost their minds over this   subject, while many others were inching closer to the same fate. The "burning   question" of the day, the question that wracked the brains of both "pitiful   scientists" and normal beings of Babylon was this:"Do we have a soul or not?"   There were all sorts of the most fantastic theories on this subject, with new   ones appearing all the time, and each and every one of the "tempting   hypotheses" had its supporters. Despite the overwhelming number and diversity   of these beliefs, they were all based on one of two completely opposing   premises. The first was called "atheism," while the other was "idealism" or   "dualism." All duelistic(sic) hypothesis held the soul existed and, of course,   that it was immortal and could suffer many things even after the death of the   being. Meanwhile, the atheistic theories held the complete opposite view. In   short, my boy, when we cam to Babylon, we came upon what could only be called   "constructing the Tower of Babel."

## HOMO DEUS: CHRISTIANITY AND CYBERMODIFICATION
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
  
  "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God." So says the Book of   Genesis. Religious components of cybernetic body modification believe the   Christian God intended the same perfection for man as He Himself possesses.   Suffering, disease, death - these exist in contradiction with divinity, but can   be overcome with the aid of science and technology. So called   "cybertheologists" interpret God's command to "subdue the earth" quite   literally. By their account, any and all means that might enable man to reach a   state closer to divinity are "good", both ethically and morally.
  
  However, some in their Christian fold have voiced concern that such   cybertheologists guilty of excessive hubris. For an immortal man would this   become his own savior, rendering the existence of the one, true ascendant God   superfluous. Only the soul should be immortal, while the human body - as a   "temple of the Holy Spirit" - should be accepted as it is: mortal and destined   for resurrection on Judgment Day.
  
  "Eritis sicut dii," said the serpent to Eve: "You will be as Gods." Religious   purists exhort their sisters and brothers in faith to resist this temptation of   Satan, masked as the will of God. But cybertheologists have stood fast and   supplemented their cause with the phrase "scientes bonum et malum". They call   upon humanity to tap into the divine and cosciously interpret for themselves   what is Good and what is Evil.

## THE UNIFICATION WAR... FOR GONKS!
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
  
  *The Unification War is the most recent armed conflict to take place in North   America since the Collapse, lasting from January 2069 to June 2070.
  
  *Although the Unification War is formally recognized as a war between the New   United States of America (NUSA) and the governments of the Free States, most   scholars also classify the conflict as a corporate war. It is well known that   the NUSA was backed by Militech hardware, personnel and other resources,   whereas the Free States received the significant yet tacit support of the   Arasaka Corporation.
  
  *The Unification War is also sometimes referred to as the Metal War or Metal   Wars, in reference to the wide use of armored cavalry units (so-called   "panzers").
  
  *The bloodiest battle in the Unification War was the Battle of Ridgecrest. In   just one day, at least 3,078 people were reported killed.
  
  *North California and South California were on opposite sides of the war,   allied with the Free States and the NUSA, respectively, while Night City   maintained a position of neutrality.
  
  *The Unification War ended when all parties signed the Treaty of Unification in   Arvin, South California. Both sides claimed victory: the Free States   emphasizing that they had preserved their independence, and the NUSA boasting   that they were closer than ever to reunifying a divided American people.
  
  *The end of the Unification War, however, was not an end to the conflict at   large. The leading AI analytics software predicts another hot war will likely   break out by 2080 (74% confidence).

## THE DAY THE TOWER FELL
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
  
  In early August 2023, a single event would change the course of history.   Although it fell against the bloody backdrop of the Fourth Corporate War, the   global media still fed on the story for weeks. And could you blame them? A   group of terrorists detonated a nuclear bomb, blowing Arasaka Tower to pieces.   The terrorists' warning came too late – not all of the Tower's employees could   be evacuated. The blast itself killed and wounded thousands, while countless   others died from radiation sickness. How did the biggest terrorist attack in   the 21st century happen? Who was behind this catastrophe? To find the answers,   we'll need to first understand the context of that era.
  
  The early 2020's was a period of unrest for Night City and anti-corporate   sentiment was at an all-time high. In the epicenter of the city's lawlessness   stood the Atlantis club. It was seen as an island of resistance against the   powers that be, primarily megacorporations like Militech or Biotechnica –   though a special place in hell was reserved for Arasaka, the Japanese   arms-manufacturing zaibatsu that held the most influence over Night City. The   kinds of people who frequented the Atlantis felt that corporations had hijacked   the future and turned people into consumer-slaves and ironically, deprived of   the two things capitalism loved most – freedom and choice. These people called   themselves Edgerunners. They positioned themselves against the corporate world   order – they declared their own freedom and opposition to the status quo. But   deprived of any peaceful way to meaningfully change what they called "the   System," they reached for more radical methods of self-expression. And these   people were no strangers to violence.

## THE UNDOING: FALL OF THE FIRST NET
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
  
  Chapter I: The Apocalypse
  
  His name was Rache Bartmoss. Everyone knows WHO destroyed the first Net. The   real question is WHY. NetWatch branded him a criminal and outlaw. The media   called him a madman. Is either label correct? You be the judge. Below is a   previously unpublished letter which Bartmoss put out just before the release of   R.A.B.I.D.S. Why has this document only now just emerged? Well... Someone out   there did not want you, my dear readers, to ever lay eyes on it. All the more   reason to take a deep dive into the information available to us.
  ‐‐ Maria Jimenez
  
  ‐‐‐‐‐ 
  
  The first Net was supposed save(sic) us. It would serve as a platform for those   without a voice. It would offer unlimited knowledge to those who hungered for   it. It would bring a fractured humanity closer together than ever before in our   history. But these hopes were hollow. False.
  
  The Net spread its tendrils around the globe faster than anyone could have   predicted. Before anyone could even consider the full range of consequences.   This "information superhighway" turned out to be our path straight to hell. We   were robbed of our privacy, deprived of our free will, stripped of our dignity.
  
  It was supposed to save us, but now even the Net itself cannot be saved. It was   molded by the corps, with sharp edges, spikes and traps at every corner. Think   of the Net as a stream of water that flows gently into our minds... before   freezing, swelling, and destroying us from the inside out. But remember this   about ice – as hard as it may be, it's surprisingly brittle. One well-placed   strike and it shatters into a million tiny pieces. Watch out today and you'll   see just what I mean.

## WHY BE ME?: CONFESSIONS OF A BRAINDANCE ADDICT

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
  
  PREFACE
  
  Do you want to be you?
  
  Seriously. Take a moment to let that question sink in. Do you feel at home in   your skin? Do you like your job? Your friends, your family? When you look in   the mirror, do you say to yourself "I'm the luckiest person alive," then hop in   the leather-upholstered backseat of your chauffeured Rayfield?
  
  If you answered "yes" to any of those questions, put down this book and stop   wasting your valuable time. If you answered "no" to the above, I understand how   you feel.
  
  It used to be said, at the turn of the century, that the world belongs to the   "one percent." Today, one thousandth of a percent is closer to the truth. And   your chances of joining this group are even less than that. In this reality, I   mean - where you are you. In a braindance, you can be anyone. A broker who   manages a portfolio worth trillions. An elite soldier who blasts his enemies   out of existence with a tech shotgun. A suave rockerboy whom the whole world   lusts after...
  
  Now, I ask you again: Of the millions upon millions of people in this world, do   you want to be you? The answer for me was always "no." And so my story begins.   [...]

## THE MAXTAC WAY, BY MATHIAS MADDOX
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
  
  FOREWORD TO THE SECOND EDITION
  
  I was fortunate, after publishing the first edition of this book, to meet many   people with fascinating stories. I spoke with people who lost loved ones at the   hands of cyberpsyshos. I met the relatives of people whom I shot. Needless to   say, not every conversation ended on good terms.
  
  After some time, I learned what questions to expect from my readers. Have you   ever been shot? (Yes, and I've lost count.) Who was the most difficult person   to kill/arrest? (The 2063 Golden Springs Mall Killer - more titanium bone and   synth-skin than man.) What causes cyberpsychosis? (I'll let you know when I   find out!)
  
  Then, at a book-signing in Heywood, I was asked a question I had never heard   before: Is there anything that keeps me awake at night? After a moment's   reflection, I realized the answer was yes. Perhaps most surprisingly, however,   it was not nightmares of eviscerated cyberpsycho victims, nor the shrieks and   cries of my squad mates as they burned alive. Cruel as it may sound, I grew   used to that. It was just part of the job. No - what caused my heart to pound   as I lie in bed late at night is the thought that one day I, too, could succumb   to cyberpsychosis. The amount of cyberware I have incorporated into my body is   substantial. Far more than most. I tried to drown the human parts of me that   fear, that doubt. I am aware just how fragile my humanity is - that piece of   myself deep within that makes me who I am. One poorly clipped neuron, one   hormonal overdose, and that piece may disappear forever, leaving behind an   automoton with only one desire: to kill. In truth, I forced my mind to race so   I would not have to confront these thoughts. Today, I still struggle with these   demons, but I have asked my wife to keep a loaded pistol in her bedside table.   If I begin to scream or rant incoherently in the middle of the night, I   instructed her to empty the entire clip between my eyes. At first she objected,   but our love is strong.
  
  It is thanks for my loving wife's promise that I have never slept as soundly as   I do now.

## IN THE SHADOWS OF MEGABUILDINGS
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
  
  One could say we're living in stable times. The 4th Corporate War is ancient   history, the Unification War is over and done with, and Night City is a free   city - a jewel embedded between two Californias. Living here, you might have   the impression that everything is OK in the world. But look around.
  
  The world is not OK. Despite technological recession between 2020 and 2040   reducing global pollution levels, humanity is still facing monumental   existential threats. Climate change has turned into climate disaster - its   effects are irreversible and dangerously unpredictable. Hurricanes, tornadoes,   droughts, floods - natural catastrophes are growing in strength and frequency   across the continent, leveling entire regions. Access to clean water is   becoming increasingly more scarce, as well as fertile land. Hunger and   starvation still reaps a bloody, human harvest in Asia and Africa, where   corporations had no interest in building vertical, hydroponic farms.
  
  Meanwhile, advances in cybermodification have given rise to a new problem:   cyberpsychosis. And though we've been aware of cyberpsychosis for over half a   century, and know that incidents of cyberpsychosis are inextricably linked to a   person's level of implantation, we still do not know why some are more prone to   carrying out violent attacks than others. Let's not also forget the more   serious issue of mass inequality, record high crime rates (including in places   like Night City) and social unrest linked to immigration in almost every corner   of the world...
  
  So I ask you again - look around. You see all of these problems in Night City   already. Maybe you're standing in the shadow of a megabuilding and you think,   "Night City is Night City - the rest of the world's problems don't affect me,   right?"
  
  Right?

## ARASAKA ACADEMY: BEST OF THE BEST, OR BEST FOR THE BEST?
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
  
  Arasaka Academy emerged as the #1 ranked institute of secondary education in   Night City for the fourth consecutive time according to the Night City   Perspective's annual review. The periodical earns the lion's share of its   advertising revenue from the academy's namesake corporation, though their   editorial staff claim this financial cooperation does not influence their   rankings.
  
  The magazine's education experts claim Arasaka Academy's infrastructure has no   equal in Night City. Bias or otherwise, we cannot argue them on this point.   Lessons are primarily conducted via virtual reality or AI-generated lesson   plans suited to a student group's specific needs. Public schools, meanwhile,   can only dream... It comes as no surprise, then, that parents who are not   gainfully employed at a megacorp are increasingly willing to incur a lifetime   of debt for a chance to give their child a chance at the city's most   prestigious education.
  
  But there are many uncomfortable truths the Academy is struggling to keep   silent. Academy administrators promote a culture of constructive competition   among its pupils as a way to forge the world's next great corporate executives.   A rat race by another name with a diploma at the finish line...
  
  Night City Perspective factors placement in corporate leadership roles into   their calculations, and with this criterion I take no issue. What they don't   include, however, is the drop-out rate. The enormous pressures these students   face inevitably translate to anxiety, depression and, for some, even suicide.   These rates are especially high for students outside the Arasaka corporate   family. Such is the dark side of Arasaka Academy's glowing reputation.

## PATHFINDER: HALF A CENTURY OF SILENCE
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
  
  When, in the summer of 2020, NASA's Pathfinder mission set off for Jupiter, it   was the buzz of every radio station, TV media outlet, and screamsheet. Stills   of the crew were plastered on every type of commemorative merchandise   imaginable: mugs, shirts, plates, bobbleheads, bumper stickers, the list goes   on.
  
  But, just a week later, the steady stream of information dried to a tickle. A   month later, the world had all but forgotten about them. Three years later, and   two years before their planned entry into Jupiter's orbit, a conflict now known   as the Fourth Corporate War broke out.
  
  Cape Canaveral was one of the first strategic sites razed to the ground -   NASA's mission control center along with it. Pathfinder, in the vast reaches of   space, had been cut off. When the opposing sides finally signed a truce three   years later, Militech set its sights on reestablishing contact with the   Pathfinder crew, but to no avail. Pathfinder's signal, it seemed, had been   swallowed by the void of the Big Black.
  
  To this day, it remains unknown whether the Pathfinder mission was a success.   If the crew ever did reach Jupiter and its moons, we have received no word, no   data, not a single lead to follow. Maybe they never stood a chance. Maybe,   after a half-century of silence, they simply have nothing to say to us.

  The yōkai first appear in Japanese literature in the year 797. These mysterious   beings, though closely linked to the invisible realm of the dead, have been   alive in the Japanese consciousness from the very birth of animism. It's not   that the Japanese believe in the yōkai. They simply know the yōkai exist.
  
  [...] In addition to phantoms, ogres and other mysterious phenomena, the yōkai   also include a group of shape-shifting demons called obake or bakemono. The   bakemono are said to sometimes take the form of a faceless person, a one-eyed   scarecrow or an animal.
  
  [...]It's said that when a cat reaches a certain age, it becomes a bakeneko.   These yōkai are able to walk on their two hind legs, speak and dance, assume   human form or even devour their owners and take their place. The bakeneko   sometimes visit people in their sleep, or even wake the dead – all they have to   do is hop over a corpse to bring it suddenly back to life.
  
  However, the demons are capable of much, much more. One should exercise extreme   caution around a double tailed cat. This is a nekomata, a yōkai with shamanic   and necromantic capabilities, able to place curses on people and control the   dead. In its human form, a nekomata resembles an old woman, often one addicted   to some substance or other and with an eerie, disturbing air about her.
  
  However, let me assure American readers of this book; today, the most likely   place you'll find a bakeneko is in the form of lucky Maneki-neko figurines.   After all, real cats are an even rarer sight these days than your average yōkai.

## WATER, CHROME AND BLOOD - THE FOURTH CORPORATE WAR
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
  
  [...] It is truly remarkable that the large-scale bloodshed of the Fourth   Corporate War began first as a simple rivalry between two ocean exploitation   corporations: CINO and OTEC. Both companies vied for the controlling stake of   the failing IHA corporation. OTEC commissioned Militech to secure its business   interests and perform certain "special operations." CINO, in turn, signed a   cooperation agreement with the Arasaka Corporation with a similar aim. When   circumstances at last called for both colossal and prideful security   corporations to clash in open combat, the Fourth War had officially begun.
  
  Yet, as is usually the case with corporate conflicts, the onset proved subtle:   Arasaka disables a Militech transport, Militech (allegedly) eliminates a   high-ranking official of an Arasaka client, both sides engage in frequent   sabotage and data theft operations, netrunners from both sides infiltrate   dataforts to sow confusion, gather intel and cause chaos in the stock markets.   Though none would have thought it possible in those early months, the   Arasaka-Militech conflict truly jeopardized the stability of the world economy,   making the threat of complete economic collapse all too real. For this reason,   NetWatch introducted(sic) a communications embargo on both corporations. This   did little to slow the conflict's pace, however. While CINO and OTEC had   unilaterally reached a settlement and reach an understanding through "peace   talks," tension between Arasaka and Militech continued to rise. This separation   from the ocean dispute marks the beginning of the Fourth War's second phase:   the so-called Shadow War.
  
  Military clashes between Militech and Arasaka were notoriously bloody, brutal   and without mercy, they waged their most damaging campaigns on the Net. Arasaka   and Militech netrunners launched attacks with the help of viruses that were   often highly experimental. What's more, they created lethal ICE measures and   AI-like programs that could lurk in dark corners of the Net for long periods to   make strikes at the most opportune times. 
  By the second half of 2022, Arasaka and Militech entered the final phase of the   conflict where both sides used every resource and strategy at their disposal.   The Hot War had begun. Around this time, the Net that the world had known for   years ceased to exist, and mercenaries hired by both corporations were   slaughtered in open warfare fought with the cutting-edge weapons technology.   Then, in the War's most shocking and iconic turning point, the coup de grâce   came when an unknown group of mercenaries denoted a nuclear device at Arasaka's   Night City headquarters. Shortly after the blast, bowing under increased   pressure from the Japanese government, Arasaka laid down its arms and withdrew   from many of its strategic positions, but most notably in Night City. Victory   belonged to Militech, but it came at a heavy cost. [...]

## LAT-AM WARS
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
  
  As a direct result of the armed conflicts on U.S. soil from the early 1990s   until the early 2000s, Latin America (comprising South and Central America)   remodeled itself into a strong federation of independent nations, bound through   mutual aid and cooperation.
  The U.S.'s military presence was forced from Latin American territories with   the exception of Panama, where it stood its ground despite fierce pressure from   guerilla forces.
  
  Many researchers and contemporary historians maintain that, in fact, the Lat-Am   Wars were responsible for the U.S.'s eventual collapse, breaking up the Gang of   Four (CIA, FBI, DEA and NSA) and decimating the U.S. Army. However, it's   important to bear in mind that no external conflict could have toppled the   colossus of American imperialism were it not already built on clay foundations.

## PROTEIN FARMS: A REPORT
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
  
  Protein farms are currently the source of most meat and meat-substitute   products in Night City. Biotechnica is the clear industry leader, providing for   over half of the city's demand for alternative protein. Currently, the most   popular, albeit cost-intensive form of production is based on protein-rich   crickets, which allow producers to achieve the highest-quality protein.   Earthworms are available as a cheaper alternative, achieving a higher yield of   product per square meter. However, worms pose a more difficult marketing   challenge - while crickets have become acceptable, most consumers still bristle   at being told to "go eat worms."

## AVIAN EXTERMINATION ACT
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
  
  The AEA was adopted by the Night City Council on May 04, 2063.
  
  Purpose: In the face of increasingly frequent and deadly zoonotic disease   outbreaks, the City Council has decided that the most effective method for   reducing the risk of infection among residents is via the extermination of all   avian life within 18 miles of city limits (See Fig.1)
  
  The extermination process will begin on May 07, 2063 once the call and   selection of tenders for the contract have been completed (See Annex 2).

## THE FALL OF ETEMENANKI
{: .notice--cyberpunk-red}

<div class="cyberpunk-bg cyberpunk-cyan">
  
  The Fall of Etemenanki 
  (manuscript found behind the Totentanz)
  
  All ye mighty 
  look and despair 
  for here lived the City
  
  in the far-off land of Shinear 
  where once was clay tamed and wrought
  
  to build a temple among the narrow streets 
  where the howl of crazed prophets rose 
  from their skiff and the shadow of the ziggurat fell across the sands
  
  Look and despair for here rose the Tower 
  strong as a tongue glazed in spit 
  held fast on the scaffolding of throats on the vocal cords
  
  up which were pulled buckets of mortar 
  prayers fragments of code late cuneiform 
  on tablets plated with copper encrusted with tin
  
  look and remember for here She fell and Her name was Babel [o Babel of dreams!]   lest we be scattered over the face of the earth 
  ask the archeologists beyond the Totentanz
  
  how she crumbled to dust the soft down of dialect 
  how the desert tore her how the sands of time ground her 
  until the word was ground fine and scattered among us
  
  look and beware in the final hours of night 
  for the sun shall rise over the ruins and dawn shall once again melt 
  from the rubble the memory of the City its original source
