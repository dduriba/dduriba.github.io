## EMERGENCY ON DEMAND
{: .notice--success}

How did it happen? When and why did we as a society decide that human life is a commodity? A luxury?

My mother passed away at 45. She still had decades of life to live until it was all stolen from her by common pneumonia. If she had held even the cheapest Trauma Team policy, she could have been cured within an hour. But she couldn't afford it. My mother died five months before her scheduled appointment with our family practitioner...

The idea of privatized healthcare is deeply ingrained in our public psyche. Already in 2020, there was widespread consensus that 500 eurodollars a month was a fair price for Trauma Team insurance. Health wasn't something you were given, it was something you earned. The private system may not be perfect, but there's no alternative, we thought.

BULLSHIT.

Now cross the Pacific Ocean to the USSR where they also have highly trained medical technicians, high-precision nanosurgical suites, specialized antibodies, intravenous probes, the list goes on. Emergency airlifts using modern AVs equipped with cryotonic chambers? They have those, too. The difference, then? They don't leave their people to die on the streets, at the store, in their homes. They don't force anyone to purchase their lives from a corporation as if they're the ones who own it.

Public healthcare isn't some unachievable utopia. It is a REALITY.

Trauma Team, on the other hand, treats its policyholders as both potential patients to be treated and potential products to be bought. They save lives only because there is profit in it. A saved life is a returning customer. Client death can also bring in fiscal gains in the form of organ and implant resale, though of course in regulated, smaller sums. An emergency care provider can't afford to give its managers reasons to deliberately kill off its clientele base for short-term windfalls.

Surely, you ask, these medical "professionals" are also guided by their Hippocratic Oaths?

Please...

## NEW RELEASE BRAINDANCES
{: .notice--success}

What's up, BD-maniacs? Hungry for a new emo-rush? Then check out the latest word from the freshest BDs on the market.

Foreign Body
The body is everything. There is nothing else. It is you, but it is also just a tool for your mind to interact with the world. But what would happen if this tool tried to live its own life? What if it tried... to kill you?
Though not a particularly original addition to the thriller genre, this braindance featuring Luke Poller is still a solid experiential ride. The fear of disobedient implants has been around since pirates were walking around on peg legs – well, maybe not that long – as a result, the trope has been pervasive in film, braindance, and urban legend alike. Still, "Foreign Body" borrows some of the genre's best elements while still incorporating just enough new stuff to the mix to keep it interesting. After all, it's not every day you see the world from the perspective of a sentient arm.

Maxwell's Rehab
This braindance season has been chock full of horror, but this one stands out from the rest. The always phenomenal Maxwell Ramirez is pushed to the brink of cyberpsychosis so we can relive his return to normalcy. The title offers a tone of optimism, but don't let that fool you. You will relive Maxwell's slip into psychosis, the heartbreak of his wife, and the gradual reintegration into a world that is now far different from how he left it. This BD is a must-relive of the season, but it's not for the faint of heart.

Badlands Raid
At last, a BD for those looking for something a little lighter. "Badlands Raid" is a remake of the 2023 classic, which was an innovative tour de force of the time. For those of you unfamiliar, the plot revolves around an ordinary, boring guy who accidentally gets tangled up in a nomad ambush on a Zetatech convoy. I won't spoil it because, even though the main plot hasn't changed in 54 years, most people these days probably don't know the ending. What I will say is this: the remake's creators have introduced a few modern twists into the story that should make for a pleasant surprise to classics-lovers and newbies alike.

## THE RELIC – WHY ALL THE FUSS?
{: .notice--success}

For years, experts in the field of cybernetics, neurology and psychology have been desperately trying to merge human consciousness with silicon. Until now, their efforts have been unsuccessful - though scientists have managed to create artificial intelligences that can compare, or indeed, surpass human intellect, copying the human "I" has remained beyond our capabilities. Attempts to do so have merely resulted in sophisticated chatbots - digital beings capable of mimicking human speech and mannerisms, but devoid of self-awareness.

Today, experts from Arasaka announced a breakthrough. Their newest project, dubbed the "Relic," allows human minds to be copied onto shards no larger than a credchip.
What's more, the shard can be slotted into one's neural port, allowing its user to "hear" and "see" digitized personality constructs.

Sadly, I haven't been able to personally examine the specifications of this remarkable piece of technology. Access to the Relic is heavily restricted by Arasaka, and only a small, select group of testers are allowed to participate in the program. Unsurprisingly, these testers are among the wealthiest and most influential people in the world - precisely the kinds of people Arasaka would like to have in its pocket. For the ordinary consumers reading this - don't expect the Relic to hit mass markets anytime soon.

## BIG 5 EMPLOYERS IN NIGHT CITY – 2077
{: .notice--success}

It's that time of the year again we present our list of the biggest and best corps to work for in Night City! Who offers paid vacation? Who pays for employees' Trauma Team insurance policies? Who provides discounts for daycare and child bodyguard services? Have a look at our rankings below!

1. Arasaka – Coming in again this year in our #1 spot the Japanese zaibatsu juggernaut. Employees can expect to be fit with the latest in cyberware technology with a loyalty obligation of only 20 years!

2. Militech – The American arms giant provides its employees with up to 50% discounts on all Militech weapons. With a deal that good, you'd be able to put a Mk.31 Heavy Machine Gun under the Christmas tree for everyone in the family!

3. Biotechnica – Our 2077 bronze medal goes to Biotechnica who offers up to six (yes, six!) paid vacation days a year!

Night Corp snuck into our Big 5 after a recent announcement to reduce the mandatory workweek to just 80 hours! They are a must-apply for all you family-focused folks out there.

## HEALTHCARE AND TRAFFIC SAFETY – TRAUMA TEAM LEADS THE WAY
{: .notice--success}

Second-rate equipment, under-trained medical "professionals", and high death rates – this is the best Night City's public emergency services have to offer. In addition to poor performance metrics, so too has their public image suffered. Scandals involving city EMTs colluding with scavengers have gone from rare to commonplace.

Recent cuts in municipal healthcare spending have led to the outright collapse of a medical system that already underperformed by most standards in the developed world. Ironically, this so-called "reform" resulted in a greater drain of doctors, nurses, paramedics and dispatchers from the public sector. Where quality healthcare was spotty before, now too is even calling the emergency hotline. Should you be among the lucky to reach a dispatcher, expect more than a half hour for an ambulance to arrive. And should you not bleed out before reaching the hospital, you're even less likely to find an available bed. Recent data show a survival rate for traffic accidents in Night City at a meager 17%.

For comparison, the average survival rate for traffic accidents across all Trauma Team policies is 91%. Response time is guaranteed to never exceed 3 minutes. Heaven on Earth? No. The minimum we all deserve. Something to keep in mind as you plan your personal budget... Purchase Trauma Team's Platinum-level coverage for the cost of Gold and safeguard your life today. Limited-time offer.

## LEFT JAB: BOXER'S MONTHLY
{: .notice--success}

Kazuo Kano – ronin from Osaka

Kazuo Kano's name is on the lips of everyone in the boxing world. The up-and-coming light heavyweight remains undefeated after twenty professional fights, seventeen of which were won by technical knockout. 
Some accuse Kano of doping, others say he has connections with the Yakuza. While training in Night City, the light heavyweight was allegedly seen "receiving" guests from Japan in his gym. Afterwards they were then seen being carried out of the gym unconscious. Wide scars have been visible near Kano's ribs for the last three fights. Local ripperdocs say that the scars definitely do not look like an appendix removal procedure... 
Will Kano become the light heavyweight champion of the world? We'll see after Malone takes his revenge on Hernandez.

## THE MOX
{: .notice--success}

(...)It's one of those stories that is either very simple or very complicated, depending on who you ask. For Janice, it was a mix of both: "The Mox came to exist because it had to. We didn't have a soul in our corner, no one to make sure street justice was on our side. So we took matters into our own hands."

The Mox is composed of the people who, if any of them disappeared from the streets tomorrow, you might never even notice: sex workers, ennyless artists, aimless rebels, and restless souls who weren't dealt a fair hand. Today, the Mox is thriving, as demonstrated by the booming biz of Lizzie's Bar. Lizzie's is renown for being arguably the best braindance club in Night City. Corporate suits, gangoons, pop stars, and locals alike all gather at Lizzie's to kick back, have a drink, and dip into the most beautifully scrolled and tuned BDs you've ever experienced. Most customers, however, are oblivious to the fact that the club is gang owned and operated, that the Mox are in charge, watching after their own. Just like the Lizzie of legend once did.

Know the story? "Lizzied used to work here back when it was just a typical dive with a stripper pole," Janice proudly explained. "She took care of the girls, made sure eddies were falling into the pockets... and their teeth weren't falling to the curb. Like this one time, this fucker (Editor's note: referring to a Tyger Claws gang member) was having too much "fun" with one of the girls, and Lizzie just couldn't stomach it anymore. Story is she deprived the worm of his little Tyger balls so quick and nasty it took them two days to clean up all the blood and puke splatter. 'Course, the Claws found out fast and they flatlined her in a flash. But everyone that she had impacted in some way, they were still around. They came together, fought back and-- (pause) Well... you already know the rest."

## NC NIGHT LIFE – DRINKS, DANCING, DEBAUCHERY
{: .notice--success}

(...) If you're a dancehead like us, don't miss out on LIZZIE'S. You'll find no better braindance club in the city, no matter how deep you dig. Modern boxes, solid tech, but most important: the catalogue, chock-full of nearly any exp you can imagine. You'll find everything you need to get you off - fast or slow, nasty or classy, and everything in-between. Don't let the girls at the front door scare you off or kill your buzz - they're wary of newcomers, but once you get in they'll treat you like one of their own. Trust us, give LIZZIE'S a try and you'll never go anywhere else. 

Now, THE AFTERLIFE? That's a different story. Sure, you can cut loose and have a good time here, but THE AFTERLIFE is a place of business above all else. Want to meet with a fixer about a job that needs doing? Discuss important gig details with a client over drinks? Or maybe just sit back and people watch, to see the comings and goings of the NC underworld's biggest merc and fixer names? THE AFTERLIFE is a great place for all of the above. The only place, really. 

If you're looking for the city's marquee events, you'll find yourself at RIOT. Chart-topping playlists, live performances from the brightest stars (both local and from around the world), DJ battles, unique music shows, and media-packed album premieres - sound like your scene? Don't miss out on RIOT. (...)

## HOW TO KEEP YOUR SHARDS AND DATA SAFE FROM PICKSOCKETS! [TOP 3 WAYS]
{: .notice--success}

Are you reading this on the street? In a store? In the metro? When was the last time you checked your neural sockets?

The picksocket plague is worse than it's ever been. The NCPD received hundreds of complaints in their last cycle from residents who reported having shards stolen from their neural sockets. How can you protect yourself? We've got you covered!

Thefts largely go uninvestigated due to the police's prioritization of violent crime, which has left picksockets feeling increasingly bold. Exploits used to hack our neuralware are widely available on the black market, so many thieves have shifted focus from our pockets to our sockets. One brief moment of inattention and your private information is flying from your neck into someone's sticky fingers. The NCPD admits tracking such thieves is difficult and a waste of resources, which is why we're here to help keep your info safe with 3 options to suit any budget.

1. Change your settings to ensure you receive notifications any time a shard is removed from a neural port. Unfortunately, this approach leads to a high number of false positives when you're fiddling with your own neuralware.
2. Invest in new sockets. Several new models on the market already have built-in safety and authorization measures to keep shards locked in tight. But if you're pinching every enny, this solution could break the bank.
3. Duct tape. Slap on a square of that and those shards aren't going anywhere. On a budget? Bad with tech? No regard for style? Then this is the option for you!

## A FAMILY OF EMPIRE
{: .notice--success}

The legacy of Arasaka needs no introduction. The Arasaka Corporation is one of the world's most powerful, with offices located in every major metropolis across the globe. For years, it has been behind the proverbial wheel of our planet's economy and society. The history of Arasaka in Night City is deserving of its own article, but suffice to say, the media industry in our city follows the family behind the megacorp as closely as they do share prices.

The story of the Arasaka family is one of empire – a true dynasty under the rule of patriarch Saburo Arasaka. Rumors of the great Saburo's retirement and cession of company control (as well as of its closely guarded secrets) to his daughter, Hanako, and son, Yorinobu, have come and passed in recent years. But has the time come where such rumors may finally contain a grain of truth?

Our sources report that Yorinobu Arasaka is currently in Night City, but not for a social call. And yet, if Yorinobu is strategizing a move for the throne, what of Hanako? Experts who follow the family closely unanimously agree that – due to "ideological" differences between Saburo and Yorinobu – Hanako will likely cement herself as the one true heir to the immense fortune and power of the Arasaka family. However, reality is hardly ever so predictable. Familial power dynamics can shift in an instant. For example, what would happen if Hanako fell from favor at a time when Yorinobu had his father's ear? And what scenario might cause such a fall?

No family is without its secrets, and the Arasakas are no exception. After all... "What appears first as heaven, appears second as hell." – Japanese proverb.

## THE VAMPIRE PRINCE IS BACK!
{: .notice--success}

Monster hunters beware!

"Turbo Dracula" is a dark, gritty, visceral action game experience where you play as the plasma-thirsty prince of puncture wounds himself – Dracula! He has risen again, this time as a digi-clone in a body of chrome... but his appetite for blood hasn't waned one bit. Assisted by the descendants of an ancient bloodline, he wages war against the sinister HelsingCorp headed by the demon brothers Manchester. They aim to take over the world with the help of genetically spliced werewolf-zombies. Dracula must face difficult choices such as whether to resurrect his old friend Viago or to transmutate into his nemeses!

A polished real-time combat system and non-linear storyline offer the player deep immersion in singleplayer, while the multiplayer mode allows you to team up with your choombas as they take control of the brooding Varney or blonde fan favorite Herbert. Without spoiling any of the endings (yes, multiple endings!), I'll leave you with just one thing... Lady Carmilla Ruthven-Batory is hands down the most captivating character ever written in the hundred-year history of video games. Period.

## NO LIFE 3 - REVIEW
{: .notice--success}

After fifty long years, the wait is finally over! The third and final installment of the No Life series will be available for purchase TOMORROW! As has been reported already, gamers should not expect any major shakeups in regard to the protagonist. We still play as strong-silent-type scientist Baron Freimensch. We follow Baron as he ventures to the Arctic Circle to... Well, why spoil it when you'll have your hands on it in less than 24 hours! The gist: with Alice at Baron's side and trusty crowbar in hand, those nasty aliens are in for a rude awakening.

## THE STRUGGLE OF O'NEILL STATION.
{: .notice--success}

The European Space Agency (ESA) started out with seemingly noble intentions: "We'll open the door to the universe." "The Solar System - a home to all." And so on an so forth.

It didn't take long for these catchphrases to reveal themselves for what they truly were - colonial ambitions wrapped up in lofty ideals. We, the builders and first inhabitants of O'Neill 1 have witnessed this first-hand. The ESA sent us into space with promises of a new life and a better tomorrow. Instead, what lay in wait for us was a complete lack of freedom and back-breaking work in extremely dangerous conditions.

We would've pulled through, we would've toughed it out for the greater good - if only they treated us as human beings, informed us of their decisions, listened to our concerns and requests... But the ESA ignored us.

The consequences were inevitable - in 2022, after completing construction of the station, our situation was critical. Station management demanded eighteen hours of work every day, seven days a week from everyone - regardless of age or health condition. Our peaceful protest was met with a disproportionate use of force, which included stun-guns. They thought it would break us, just like the countless protests they broke back on Earth.

The thing is, out here it's not so easy to call for reinforcements. Workers outnumbered guards 40:1, and one stun-gun charge held only fifteen rounds. The ESA's management had effectively shot themselves in the foot. It was over before they could realize - only seven hours passed before O'Neill 1 and O'Neill 2 declared independence and became the first nations established outside of Earth...

## DR. HAVOC & RADON
{: .notice--success}

Introduction

The Battery Sphere is in dire straits. The Irinians have occupied almost half the city. Them and their technorat scourge have transformed almost everyone in hordes of mindless zombies. Battery Arena is now the final point of resistance against the invaders from Planet X. It seems the end if inevitable. That is...
until the legendary mercenary pair arrive just in the nick of time after years of mysterious absence! Amidst the cigar smoke and glint of chrome armor, Dr. Havoc and Radon slaughter scores of enemies without mercy. After all, who could possibly slow the mighty force of a laser-armed mountain of muscle and his spitfire of a sidekick who can transform into a sentient cloud of radioactive gas?

I'll tell you - no one so far. Rose Tenorio and Martoni Eleazar take us into the world of computer games first imagined in the bestseller novel "Kibble and Scop" by Abe Frost. Fasten your seatbelts and get ready for a roller coaster ride of comic-book violence! If you've ever wondered what the action of the BATTERY ARENA may have looked like, "Dr. Havoc & Radon" is a must-buy. Dive in now.

## THE SOLO'S MANUAL BY MORGAN BLACKHAND
{: .notice--success}

INTRO

Think you've got what it takes to be a legendary solo, huh? Sure you do. Otherwise, why pick up this book? You're looking for respect. For fear. For a way to be on top. Maybe you heard someone quote me about winning battles with only a glance, before a single shot's been fired. Well fine, I'll let you in on a secret: it is possible, and you can do it too, but only if you got the guts to survive going to hell and back more times than you can count. Thousands of fights, millions of bullets, hundreds of gallons of blood (yours included) - that's what you have to look forward to. And you'll need a solid ripper - one you can trust, one you make a lifelong choombatta out of, one who tells you every week, "It's a miracle you ain't dead by now." At least, that's what he'll say if you're lucky.

Nowadays, every kid with big iron, a syn-leather coat and a micro-missile launcher thinks they're a hotshot solo. But you know what? Just because you killed a few goons with a smile on your lips don't make you one. Anyone can kill. I knew this rockerboy once who blew up a whole fucking platoon of corpotrash. Did that make him a solo? No, it made him dead.

So you still think you got what it takes to carve your name into solo history?

Good. Then this book's for you.

## KIBBLE AND SCOP
{: .notice--success}

Kibble stared glumly at his glass of a seaweed-colored drink. A part of him hoped the bartender had poured a pint of rat poison by mistake. "I don't get it, choom...", he murmured gloomily. "At school, they said I had talent, a real knack for acting. Was it all a fucking lie, or what?"

"Dude, there are billions of people on this rock," Scop shrugged. "Can't work out for everyone."

Kibble flicked on his olfactory booster and gave his beverage a whiff. Smelled just like the wet mop in the bathroom - maybe worse. Then, not knowing why, he suddenly recalled the merc he talked to a week ago in a popular punk dive he liked to frequent. Well, okay, maybe "talked" is generous, but grievances were certainly aired. The merc swept the floor with him that night and threatened to put a bullet between his tonsils if he ever spilled her tequila again.

This is it, he thought. Rotgut and tequila. Unemployed losers and hotshit mercs. The latter with the world at their feet. It's people like Kibble who are just a theater set piece, who make up the backdrop against which the Sandevistan-boosted mercs of the world can shine bright as stars. Kibble decided then and there that he didn't want to be just a splotch in the background anymore.

"Why? Why doesn't it ever shake out for us?", he asked with sour grimace. "Why does this city only reward bloodthirsty, bulletcrazy punks while the rest of us normal saps without murderous tendencies have to huddle over our cheap glasses of green cockroach piss?"

Scop shrugged again. "I dunno, find a gun, buy an edgy jacket," he suggested indifferently with a note of sarcasm. "Shoot up some gang haunts. Have the punkiest time of your life for four and a half seconds."

"What the hell happened here?" Kibble continued his rant. "The world's all upside-down! There are billions just like you and me. Billions of do-nothings, cowards... No, not cowards - people who just want things to be normal! Safety. Life... Life, Scop!"

Scop had already opened his mouth, ready to list off another round of cynical retorts, but then stopped himself short and started a tangent of his own. ife..." he repeated slowly and ponderously. "What if I could sell the world... an alternate life? The same all those edgerunners feel, except where you won't ever die like they do."

Kibble snorted and spat out the cockroach piss he finally mustered the courage to taste. "Sorry to burst your bubble, choom, but somebody's way ahead of ya there. Ever heard of Bloody Bout IV? Or, like... a million other computer games?"

Scop cracked a roguish smile. "Is Bloody Bout IV or these 'million other games' designed to work on a hybrid braindance system? Y'know, the kind I made a breakthrough on just last week?"

## 1,000 BEATS A SECOND
{: .notice--success} 

I couldn't believe my eyes. For a moment, I thought Jessica had changed them out for faulty Kiroshis while I was asleep. But no, that wouldn't have been like her. I blinked again. No change. There I saw them, clear as day, the open flaps of Jason's chrome skull. I saw the electronic brain that, up until now, had been hidden by perfect imitation syn-skin.

The son of FutureTech CEO, the boy of my damn dreams, Jason... He was an android. Shit...

I sat there stuck with a dumb expression on my face and Jason stared back with one of his own. I couldn't help but wonder now... were those beautiful eyes of his - the same that had pierced my soul - were they merely a mimicry controlled by some emo-algorithm? Had there never been anything real behind them all those times? ... Not once?

"Alex!...I-it's not what you think!" he pleaded with a strangely authentic note of panic in his voice. And I wanted to believe him. I really did.

"Hmph... Well, clearly it hasn't been," I replied in equal parts anxious and bitter. "Me and my rotten luck... The first and last guy I fall for and he turns out to be a goddamn motherboard on legs!"

"No, that's not--," Jason suddenly broke off and smiled awkwardly. "Wait, did you... did you say 'fall for?'"

My cardio implant began to beat more and more quickly. My face flushed. Had I been wrong? Could this body of bolts, wires, and plastic contain whatever is left of the real Jason Cadalez? If his father was able to design a synthetic heart for me, maybe he could do the same for his son's brain. The question is... why?

## SAYONARA STATION, BY LUKE STEELMAN
{: .notice--success} 

Wait a second, before we start - have you wondered how this book ended up in your hands? Where it came from, who delivered it?

Of course you haven't - nobody ever wonders about things like that. It's a shame, because the answer's quite interesting. I'd go as far as to say it's fucking fascinating.

Not so long ago, most shipments were made via sea on freighters. Cheap, quick and (relatively) safe. But during the Fourth Corporate War, some genius in Arasaka had an idea - to release automated, self-replicating mines controlled by an AI into the ocean. What could possibly go wrong? A lot, it turns out.

The AI had a single objective: "Destroy enemy vessels." Simple, right? NUSA/Militech ships would get blown out of the water, while the Arasaka/Free State ships would sail by untouched. Except for the AI's iron-clad logic - since there was a non-zero probability that a vessel waving a friendly flag might also have enemies on board, in the interest of optimization it would also be sunk. Of course, when the leadheads back at Arasaka HQ realized what they'd done, they rushed to update the software - only for the AI to reject it as a virus. And thus, because of a handful of individuals' complete lack of imagination and foresight, the history of maritime travel came to an end.

So let's come back to the question - how did you end up with this book? Unless you live in Chicago, where it was published, then surely not via the Net - since that was destroyed by Bartmoss. Maybe it was shipped by plane? But air freight is incredibly expensive, so most likely not. By car then? We can't rule it out. But if I had to bet on it, I'd say it came to your city via train.

Imagine that trains (that's right, the ones that go choo! choo!) have survived into the present-day? Just last year, 15,526 miles of new train tracks were put into use, including the underground tunnel connecting Tokyo with Shanghai. At top-speed, an armored train can complete the distance between the two cities in under five hours! Now that's something I had to experience for myself. Two days later I was in Tokyo, standing on the platform of Sayonara Station...

## CYBERWARE USAGE AND ITS SIDE EFFECTS
{: .notice--success}

Many people believe we live in a time when "impossible" has become an obsolete term. Ripperdocs can replace nearly any part of the human body with artificial implants, from your big toe to portions of the nervous system. My years in Trauma Team, however, taught me that the "impossible" is still very much possible. Even now, as we enter the twilight of the twenty-first century, we as medical professionals have not been able to eliminate all of the side effects that come from incorporating cybernetic elements into our bodies. Of course, everyone is familiar with the mental disorder most commonly referred to as cyberpsychosis. But it doesn't end there. Although advances in medical science for the greater part of a century have reduced its incidence to a minimum, cyberware rejection can still occur in a small subset of the population. These unlucky few can experience a range of complications, but the following are the most prevalent:

1. Immune Response – The body rejects the implant, causing scar tissue to continue growing to the point that it causes pain and inflammation of surrounding tissue as well as possible interference with the tech's electrical circuits.

2. Psychological Effects – Neurological implants have the potential to cause unpredictable change in the brain. Possible side effects include depression, apathy, hallucinations and sudden increases in addictive behaviors, such as gambling.

3. Implant Overdependence – Long-term use of certain synthetic body part replacements can change the brain's chemistry to make it accustomed to a particular type of implant. There are reported cases of permanent blindness after patients attempted to replace their Kiroshi optical implants with different models.

In the face of these known risks, what should our outlook be as consumers and medical professionals? To deny ourselves cybernetic enhancements on the 0.5 percent chance we could lose our vision forever? Or gamble away our life savings at the casino? The clear answer is "No." Cyberware technology has elevated human biology to the point where these what-if arguments serve against our best interests. The best advice I can offer for minimizing your risk is to read the technomedical profiles for all cyberware you intend to purchase before you install it.

## PAIN EDITORS AND MORTALITY RATES
{: .notice--success}

Introduction

The implant known widely as the "pain editor" is cyberware that reduces or even entirely eliminates pain. It has enjoyed unwavering popularity for years among certain circles in Night City, the most devoted, and arguably most valuable, of which is mercenaries. It is using this test group that Zetatech conducted the following research.

The pain editor is a neural coprocessor that inhibits the signals sent from nociceptors to the parietal lobe of the brain, thus preventing feelings of pain in the user. (Note: Some models also reduce symptoms of fatigue.) The beneficial effects caused by the pain editor are in some ways similar to the symptoms of hypoesthesia, including greater resistance to physical forms of torture and the ability to ignore pain from severe wounds which can allow the user to continue perform beyond normal human limitations for a brief period.

However, some studies have reported that the pain editor can yield a range of undesirable side effects. For example, in the heat of battle, some users are unaware of the severity of their wounds, which causes them to continue fighting without realizing they are dying and require immediate medical attention. The statistics support the theory that a lack of negative reinforcement may cause users to continue fighting when the rational strategy would be to retreat and escape death. Since 2020, the mortality rate of pain editor owners is above 60 percent.

In this report, I address the question of how to better protect Zetatech clients from avoidable death while using our pain editors(...)

## RELIVE.IT - BRAINDANCE QUARTERLY
{: .notice--success}

GUEST EDITORIAL

Braindance editors have long strived to strike a balance between real, lived experience and technological, experiential purity. The more heavily processed the material, the more abstracted the pathways, the clearer the braindance recording; these fundamental elements of design have guided editors since the first wave of brain-to-brain experience sharing technology took hold. In their pursuit of balance, however, editors have clearly shown a bias for purity over naturalism over the years, even going so far to use it as a point of pride in the quality of their production.

But in the industry's latest push for greater purity has the purpose of the technology already been forgotten? Will we not find ourselves processing and filtering a braindance recording to the point that the emotional experience no longer extends beyond what we receive from film, television and video games? After reliving some of the latest titles on my feeder unit, this once-academic question now feels all too inevitable with the industry's current trajectory.

For a moment, let's consider why some reports suggest more and more users are searching for unlicensed titles on the black market (so-called black braindances, extreme braindances, or XBDs). Are we so sure it's the illicit content they are after? Or maybe the real draw is the residual "grit" we editors try so hard to remove? Distracting thoughts, irrelevant memories, loose associative threads, emotions stretching beyond the desired spectrum... What if this "noise" is not so superfluous as we believe it to be? What if these peripheral experiences hold the potential to elevate a good braindance to an exquisite one? We do ourselves a disservice by not exploring these questions before our blind crusade for braindance purity leads this industry straight into the bin of obsolete, flash-in-the-pan technology.

## CAN CYBERPSYCHOSIS BE CURED?
{: .notice--success}

Can cyberpsychosis be cured? Opinions on that question are divided. Only a few years ago so-called braindance therapy was used across the entire country on a mass scale with the aim of bringing the sick back from the point of no return. The patient would be placed on a special chair and connected to a device that would deactivate all implants. 
Then electrodes would be attached, inducing the patient into a coma-like braindance session. This was then followed up by medicine, psychosurgery and the aversion therapy. 
The overall treatment was intended to sever all the patient's neural connections and tie them back together so that the cyberpsycho could return to society. Once the therapy was concluded, no symptoms of cyberpsychosis were detected, as well as the patient's former personality. But don't worry - nowadays other methods are used. At least, that's what they tell us.

## 75 YEARS OF CYBERWARE, BY TSUTOMU TAKAHASHI
{: .notice--success}

INTRODUCTION

A century ago, losing a limb meant tragedy. It meant living with permanent disability, with severely reduced physical capability, and often with a chronic pain. What's more, people with disabilities frequently suffered from widespread discrimination, both active (e.g. employment bias) and passive or unconscious (e.g. poor infrastructural inaccessibility). Today, assuming the dismemberment victim is financially stable, loss of limb amounts to little more than a minor inconvenience.

A century ago, employers could impose specific dress codes, hairstyle regulations, and piercing and tattoo bans. Many even pressed their employees to maximize productivity often in violation of the law, such as through anti-pregnancy policies. At the time, however, deeper involvement with employees' bodies was simply impossible, legal or otherwise. But, with the advent of cyberware, employers in the second half of the twenty-first century have imposed requirements for skin, bone, muscle, organ and eye replacements in order to improve performance and workplace effectiveness In extreme cases, security sector employees are commonly urged to undergo so-called full body conversions, or full cyborgization.

Much has changed over the past seventy-five years from when cybernetic implants first hit the mass market. Many in the field of history of technology have argued cyberware is a positive force for progress, and many have argued the opposite. This book attempts to describe and contextualize the changes - for better or worse - that it has introduced to our professional and personal lives. How has cyberware led us to where we are today, and where is it taking us next?

(...)But, besides all this, death is the great opportunity no longer to be I;—to him who uses it. During life the will of man is without freedom: his action takes place with necessity upon the basis of his unalterable character in the chain of motives. But every one remembers much that he has done, and on account of which he is by no means satisfied with himself. If now he were to go on living, he would go on acting in the same way, on account of the unalterable nature of his character. Accordingly he must cease to be what he is in order to be able to arise out of the germ of his nature as a new and different being. Therefore death looses these bonds; the will again becomes free; for freedom lies in the Esse, not in the Operari(...)

## BEELZEBUB'S TALES TO HIS GRANDSON
{: .notice--success}

Even before our arrival, many beings in Babylon had lost their minds over this subject, while many others were inching closer to the same fate. The "burning question" of the day, the question that wracked the brains of both "pitiful scientists" and normal beings of Babylon was this:"Do we have a soul or not?" There were all sorts of the most fantastic theories on this subject, with new ones appearing all the time, and each and every one of the "tempting hypotheses" had its supporters. Despite the overwhelming number and diversity of these beliefs, they were all based on one of two completely opposing premises. The first was called "atheism," while the other was "idealism" or "dualism." All duelistic(sic) hypothesis held the soul existed and, of course, that it was immortal and could suffer many things even after the death of the being. Meanwhile, the atheistic theories held the complete opposite view. In short, my boy, when we cam to Babylon, we came upon what could only be called "constructing the Tower of Babel."

## HOMO DEUS: CHRISTIANITY AND CYBERMODIFICATION
{: .notice--success}

"So God created man in his own image, in the image of God." So says the Book of Genesis. Religious components of cybernetic body modification believe the Christian God intended the same perfection for man as He Himself possesses. Suffering, disease, death - these exist in contradiction with divinity, but can be overcome with the aid of science and technology. So called "cybertheologists" interpret God's command to "subdue the earth" quite literally. By their account, any and all means that might enable man to reach a state closer to divinity are "good", both ethically and morally.

However, some in their Christian fold have voiced concern that such cybertheologists guilty of excessive hubris. For an immortal man would this become his own savior, rendering the existence of the one, true ascendant God superfluous. Only the soul should be immortal, while the human body - as a "temple of the Holy Spirit" - should be accepted as it is: mortal and destined for resurrection on Judgment Day.

"Eritis sicut dii," said the serpent to Eve: "You will be as Gods." Religious purists exhort their sisters and brothers in faith to resist this temptation of Satan, masked as the will of God. But cybertheologists have stood fast and supplemented their cause with the phrase "scientes bonum et malum". They call upon humanity to tap into the divine and cosciously interpret for themselves what is Good and what is Evil.

## THE UNIFICATION WAR... FOR GONKS!
{: .notice--success}

*The Unification War is the most recent armed conflict to take place in North America since the Collapse, lasting from January 2069 to June 2070.

*Although the Unification War is formally recognized as a war between the New United States of America (NUSA) and the governments of the Free States, most scholars also classify the conflict as a corporate war. It is well known that the NUSA was backed by Militech hardware, personnel and other resources, whereas the Free States received the significant yet tacit support of the Arasaka Corporation.

*The Unification War is also sometimes referred to as the Metal War or Metal Wars, in reference to the wide use of armored cavalry units (so-called "panzers").

*The bloodiest battle in the Unification War was the Battle of Ridgecrest. In just one day, at least 3,078 people were reported killed.

*North California and South California were on opposite sides of the war, allied with the Free States and the NUSA, respectively, while Night City maintained a position of neutrality.

*The Unification War ended when all parties signed the Treaty of Unification in Arvin, South California. Both sides claimed victory: the Free States emphasizing that they had preserved their independence, and the NUSA boasting that they were closer than ever to reunifying a divided American people.

*The end of the Unification War, however, was not an end to the conflict at large. The leading AI analytics software predicts another hot war will likely break out by 2080 (74% confidence).

## THE DAY THE TOWER FELL
{: .notice--success}

In early August 2023, a single event would change the course of history. Although it fell against the bloody backdrop of the Fourth Corporate War, the global media still fed on the story for weeks. And could you blame them? A group of terrorists detonated a nuclear bomb, blowing Arasaka Tower to pieces. The terrorists' warning came too late – not all of the Tower's employees could be evacuated. The blast itself killed and wounded thousands, while countless others died from radiation sickness. How did the biggest terrorist attack in the 21st century happen? Who was behind this catastrophe? To find the answers, we'll need to first understand the context of that era.

The early 2020's was a period of unrest for Night City and anti-corporate sentiment was at an all-time high. In the epicenter of the city's lawlessness stood the Atlantis club. It was seen as an island of resistance against the powers that be, primarily megacorporations like Militech or Biotechnica – though a special place in hell was reserved for Arasaka, the Japanese arms-manufacturing zaibatsu that held the most influence over Night City. The kinds of people who frequented the Atlantis felt that corporations had hijacked the future and turned people into consumer-slaves and ironically, deprived of the two things capitalism loved most – freedom and choice. These people called themselves Edgerunners. They positioned themselves against the corporate world order – they declared their own freedom and opposition to the status quo. But deprived of any peaceful way to meaningfully change what they called "the System," they reached for more radical methods of self-expression. And these people were no strangers to violence.

## THE UNDOING: FALL OF THE FIRST NET
{: .notice--success}

Chapter I: The Apocalypse

His name was Rache Bartmoss. Everyone knows WHO destroyed the first Net. The real question is WHY. NetWatch branded him a criminal and outlaw. The media called him a madman. Is either label correct? You be the judge. Below is a previously unpublished letter which Bartmoss put out just before the release of R.A.B.I.D.S. Why has this document only now just emerged? Well... Someone out there did not want you, my dear readers, to ever lay eyes on it. All the more reason to take a deep dive into the information available to us.
‐‐ Maria Jimenez

‐‐‐‐‐ 

The first Net was supposed save(sic) us. It would serve as a platform for those without a voice. It would offer unlimited knowledge to those who hungered for it. It would bring a fractured humanity closer together than ever before in our history. But these hopes were hollow. False.

The Net spread its tendrils around the globe faster than anyone could have predicted. Before anyone could even consider the full range of consequences. This "information superhighway" turned out to be our path straight to hell. We were robbed of our privacy, deprived of our free will, stripped of our dignity.

It was supposed to save us, but now even the Net itself cannot be saved. It was molded by the corps, with sharp edges, spikes and traps at every corner. Think of the Net as a stream of water that flows gently into our minds... before freezing, swelling, and destroying us from the inside out. But remember this about ice – as hard as it may be, it's surprisingly brittle. One well-placed strike and it shatters into a million tiny pieces. Watch out today and you'll see just what I mean.

## WHY BE ME?: CONFESSIONS OF A BRAINDANCE ADDICT
{: .notice--success}

PREFACE

Do you want to be you?

Seriously. Take a moment to let that question sink in. Do you feel at home in your skin? Do you like your job? Your friends, your family? When you look in the mirror, do you say to yourself "I'm the luckiest person alive," then hop in the leather-upholstered backseat of your chauffeured Rayfield?

If you answered "yes" to any of those questions, put down this book and stop wasting your valuable time. If you answered "no" to the above, I understand how you feel.

It used to be said, at the turn of the century, that the world belongs to the "one percent." Today, one thousandth of a percent is closer to the truth. And your chances of joining this group are even less than that. In this reality, I mean - where you are you. In a braindance, you can be anyone. A broker who manages a portfolio worth trillions. An elite soldier who blasts his enemies out of existence with a tech shotgun. A suave rockerboy whom the whole world lusts after...

Now, I ask you again: Of the millions upon millions of people in this world, do you want to be you? The answer for me was always "no." And so my story begins. (...)

## THE MAXTAC WAY, BY MATHIAS MADDOX
{: .notice--success}

FOREWORD TO THE SECOND EDITION

I was fortunate, after publishing the first edition of this book, to meet many people with fascinating stories. I spoke with people who lost loved ones at the hands of cyberpsyshos. I met the relatives of people whom I shot. Needless to say, not every conversation ended on good terms.

After some time, I learned what questions to expect from my readers. Have you ever been shot? (Yes, and I've lost count.) Who was the most difficult person to kill/arrest? (The 2063 Golden Springs Mall Killer - more titanium bone and synth-skin than man.) What causes cyberpsychosis? (I'll let you know when I find out!)

Then, at a book-signing in Heywood, I was asked a question I had never heard before: Is there anything that keeps me awake at night? After a moment's reflection, I realized the answer was yes. Perhaps most surprisingly, however, it was not nightmares of eviscerated cyberpsycho victims, nor the shrieks and cries of my squad mates as they burned alive. Cruel as it may sound, I grew used to that. It was just part of the job. No - what caused my heart to pound as I lie in bed late at night is the thought that one day I, too, could succumb to cyberpsychosis. The amount of cyberware I have incorporated into my body is substantial. Far more than most. I tried to drown the human parts of me that fear, that doubt. I am aware just how fragile my humanity is - that piece of myself deep within that makes me who I am. One poorly clipped neuron, one hormonal overdose, and that piece may disappear forever, leaving behind an automoton with only one desire: to kill. In truth, I forced my mind to race so I would not have to confront these thoughts. Today, I still struggle with these demons, but I have asked my wife to keep a loaded pistol in her bedside table. If I begin to scream or rant incoherently in the middle of the night, I instructed her to empty the entire clip between my eyes. At first she objected, but our love is strong.

It is thanks for my loving wife's promise that I have never slept as soundly as I do now.
