## EMERGENCY ON DEMAND
{: .notice--success}

How did it happen? When and why did we as a society decide that human life is a commodity? A luxury?

My mother passed away at 45. She still had decades of life to live until it was all stolen from her by common pneumonia. If she had held even the cheapest Trauma Team policy, she could have been cured within an hour. But she couldn't afford it. My mother died five months before her scheduled appointment with our family practitioner...

The idea of privatized healthcare is deeply ingrained in our public psyche. Already in 2020, there was widespread consensus that 500 eurodollars a month was a fair price for Trauma Team insurance. Health wasn't something you were given, it was something you earned. The private system may not be perfect, but there's no alternative, we thought.

BULLSHIT.

Now cross the Pacific Ocean to the USSR where they also have highly trained medical technicians, high-precision nanosurgical suites, specialized antibodies, intravenous probes, the list goes on. Emergency airlifts using modern AVs equipped with cryotonic chambers? They have those, too. The difference, then? They don't leave their people to die on the streets, at the store, in their homes. They don't force anyone to purchase their lives from a corporation as if they're the ones who own it.

Public healthcare isn't some unachievable utopia. It is a REALITY.

Trauma Team, on the other hand, treats its policyholders as both potential patients to be treated and potential products to be bought. They save lives only because there is profit in it. A saved life is a returning customer. Client death can also bring in fiscal gains in the form of organ and implant resale, though of course in regulated, smaller sums. An emergency care provider can't afford to give its managers reasons to deliberately kill off its clientele base for short-term windfalls.

Surely, you ask, these medical "professionals" are also guided by their Hippocratic Oaths?

Please...

## NEW RELEASE BRAINDANCES
{: .notice--success}

What's up, BD-maniacs? Hungry for a new emo-rush? Then check out the latest word from the freshest BDs on the market.

Foreign Body
The body is everything. There is nothing else. It is you, but it is also just a tool for your mind to interact with the world. But what would happen if this tool tried to live its own life? What if it tried... to kill you?
Though not a particularly original addition to the thriller genre, this braindance featuring Luke Poller is still a solid experiential ride. The fear of disobedient implants has been around since pirates were walking around on peg legs – well, maybe not that long – as a result, the trope has been pervasive in film, braindance, and urban legend alike. Still, "Foreign Body" borrows some of the genre's best elements while still incorporating just enough new stuff to the mix to keep it interesting. After all, it's not every day you see the world from the perspective of a sentient arm.

Maxwell's Rehab
This braindance season has been chock full of horror, but this one stands out from the rest. The always phenomenal Maxwell Ramirez is pushed to the brink of cyberpsychosis so we can relive his return to normalcy. The title offers a tone of optimism, but don't let that fool you. You will relive Maxwell's slip into psychosis, the heartbreak of his wife, and the gradual reintegration into a world that is now far different from how he left it. This BD is a must-relive of the season, but it's not for the faint of heart.

Badlands Raid
At last, a BD for those looking for something a little lighter. "Badlands Raid" is a remake of the 2023 classic, which was an innovative tour de force of the time. For those of you unfamiliar, the plot revolves around an ordinary, boring guy who accidentally gets tangled up in a nomad ambush on a Zetatech convoy. I won't spoil it because, even though the main plot hasn't changed in 54 years, most people these days probably don't know the ending. What I will say is this: the remake's creators have introduced a few modern twists into the story that should make for a pleasant surprise to classics-lovers and newbies alike.

## THE RELIC – WHY ALL THE FUSS?
{: .notice--success}

For years, experts in the field of cybernetics, neurology and psychology have been desperately trying to merge human consciousness with silicon. Until now, their efforts have been unsuccessful - though scientists have managed to create artificial intelligences that can compare, or indeed, surpass human intellect, copying the human "I" has remained beyond our capabilities. Attempts to do so have merely resulted in sophisticated chatbots - digital beings capable of mimicking human speech and mannerisms, but devoid of self-awareness.

Today, experts from Arasaka announced a breakthrough. Their newest project, dubbed the "Relic," allows human minds to be copied onto shards no larger than a credchip.
What's more, the shard can be slotted into one's neural port, allowing its user to "hear" and "see" digitized personality constructs.

Sadly, I haven't been able to personally examine the specifications of this remarkable piece of technology. Access to the Relic is heavily restricted by Arasaka, and only a small, select group of testers are allowed to participate in the program. Unsurprisingly, these testers are among the wealthiest and most influential people in the world - precisely the kinds of people Arasaka would like to have in its pocket. For the ordinary consumers reading this - don't expect the Relic to hit mass markets anytime soon.

## BIG 5 EMPLOYERS IN NIGHT CITY – 2077
{: .notice--success}

It's that time of the year again we present our list of the biggest and best corps to work for in Night City! Who offers paid vacation? Who pays for employees' Trauma Team insurance policies? Who provides discounts for daycare and child bodyguard services? Have a look at our rankings below!

1. Arasaka – Coming in again this year in our #1 spot the Japanese zaibatsu juggernaut. Employees can expect to be fit with the latest in cyberware technology with a loyalty obligation of only 20 years!

2. Militech – The American arms giant provides its employees with up to 50% discounts on all Militech weapons. With a deal that good, you'd be able to put a Mk.31 Heavy Machine Gun under the Christmas tree for everyone in the family!

3. Biotechnica – Our 2077 bronze medal goes to Biotechnica who offers up to six (yes, six!) paid vacation days a year!

4. Kang Tao – China's largest tech and arms manufacturer treats its employees to a Gold Membership with Trauma Team. Never spend a single minute of your 50-year loyalty pledge worrying about paying for health coverage!

5. Night Corp – While this hometown product can't compete with the biggest international players in terms of budget or ambition, they certainly know how to spoil their staff. Night Corp snuck into our Big 5 after a recent announcement to reduce the mandatory workweek to just 80 hours! They are a must-apply for all you family-focused folks out there.

## HEALTHCARE AND TRAFFIC SAFETY – TRAUMA TEAM LEADS THE WAY
{: .notice--success}

Second-rate equipment, under-trained medical "professionals", and high death rates – this is the best Night City's public emergency services have to offer. In addition to poor performance metrics, so too has their public image suffered. Scandals involving city EMTs colluding with scavengers have gone from rare to commonplace.

Recent cuts in municipal healthcare spending have led to the outright collapse of a medical system that already underperformed by most standards in the developed world. Ironically, this so-called "reform" resulted in a greater drain of doctors, nurses, paramedics and dispatchers from the public sector. Where quality healthcare was spotty before, now too is even calling the emergency hotline. Should you be among the lucky to reach a dispatcher, expect more than a half hour for an ambulance to arrive. And should you not bleed out before reaching the hospital, you're even less likely to find an available bed. Recent data show a survival rate for traffic accidents in Night City at a meager 17%.

For comparison, the average survival rate for traffic accidents across all Trauma Team policies is 91%. Response time is guaranteed to never exceed 3 minutes. Heaven on Earth? No. The minimum we all deserve. Something to keep in mind as you plan your personal budget... Purchase Trauma Team's Platinum-level coverage for the cost of Gold and safeguard your life today. Limited-time offer.

## CYBERWARE USAGE AND ITS SIDE EFFECTS
{: .notice--success}

Many people believe we live in a time when "impossible" has become an obsolete term. Ripperdocs can replace nearly any part of the human body with artificial implants, from your big toe to portions of the nervous system. My years in Trauma Team, however, taught me that the "impossible" is still very much possible. Even now, as we enter the twilight of the twenty-first century, we as medical professionals have not been able to eliminate all of the side effects that come from incorporating cybernetic elements into our bodies. Of course, everyone is familiar with the mental disorder most commonly referred to as cyberpsychosis. But it doesn't end there. Although advances in medical science for the greater part of a century have reduced its incidence to a minimum, cyberware rejection can still occur in a small subset of the population. These unlucky few can experience a range of complications, but the following are the most prevalent:

1. Immune Response – The body rejects the implant, causing scar tissue to continue growing to the point that it causes pain and inflammation of surrounding tissue as well as possible interference with the tech's electrical circuits.

2. Psychological Effects – Neurological implants have the potential to cause unpredictable change in the brain. Possible side effects include depression, apathy, hallucinations and sudden increases in addictive behaviors, such as gambling.

3. Implant Overdependence – Long-term use of certain synthetic body part replacements can change the brain's chemistry to make it accustomed to a particular type of implant. There are reported cases of permanent blindness after patients attempted to replace their Kiroshi optical implants with different models.

In the face of these known risks, what should our outlook be as consumers and medical professionals? To deny ourselves cybernetic enhancements on the 0.5 percent chance we could lose our vision forever? Or gamble away our life savings at the casino? The clear answer is "No." Cyberware technology has elevated human biology to the point where these what-if arguments serve against our best interests. The best advice I can offer for minimizing your risk is to read the technomedical profiles for all cyberware you intend to purchase before you install it.

## PAIN EDITORS AND MORTALITY RATES
{: .notice--success}

Introduction

The implant known widely as the "pain editor" is cyberware that reduces or even entirely eliminates pain. It has enjoyed unwavering popularity for years among certain circles in Night City, the most devoted, and arguably most valuable, of which is mercenaries. It is using this test group that Zetatech conducted the following research.

The pain editor is a neural coprocessor that inhibits the signals sent from nociceptors to the parietal lobe of the brain, thus preventing feelings of pain in the user. (Note: Some models also reduce symptoms of fatigue.) The beneficial effects caused by the pain editor are in some ways similar to the symptoms of hypoesthesia, including greater resistance to physical forms of torture and the ability to ignore pain from severe wounds which can allow the user to continue perform beyond normal human limitations for a brief period.

However, some studies have reported that the pain editor can yield a range of undesirable side effects. For example, in the heat of battle, some users are unaware of the severity of their wounds, which causes them to continue fighting without realizing they are dying and require immediate medical attention. The statistics support the theory that a lack of negative reinforcement may cause users to continue fighting when the rational strategy would be to retreat and escape death. Since 2020, the mortality rate of pain editor owners is above 60 percent.

In this report, I address the question of how to better protect Zetatech clients from avoidable death while using our pain editors(...)

## THE UNIFICATION WAR... FOR GONKS!
{: .notice--success}

*The Unification War is the most recent armed conflict to take place in North America since the Collapse, lasting from January 2069 to June 2070.

*Although the Unification War is formally recognized as a war between the New United States of America (NUSA) and the governments of the Free States, most scholars also classify the conflict as a corporate war. It is well known that the NUSA was backed by Militech hardware, personnel and other resources, whereas the Free States received the significant yet tacit support of the Arasaka Corporation.

*The Unification War is also sometimes referred to as the Metal War or Metal Wars, in reference to the wide use of armored cavalry units (so-called "panzers").

*The bloodiest battle in the Unification War was the Battle of Ridgecrest. In just one day, at least 3,078 people were reported killed.

*North California and South California were on opposite sides of the war, allied with the Free States and the NUSA, respectively, while Night City maintained a position of neutrality.

*The Unification War ended when all parties signed the Treaty of Unification in Arvin, South California. Both sides claimed victory: the Free States emphasizing that they had preserved their independence, and the NUSA boasting that they were closer than ever to reunifying a divided American people.

*The end of the Unification War, however, was not an end to the conflict at large. The leading AI analytics software predicts another hot war will likely break out by 2080 (74% confidence).

## THE DAY THE TOWER FELL
{: .notice--success}

In early August 2023, a single event would change the course of history. Although it fell against the bloody backdrop of the Fourth Corporate War, the global media still fed on the story for weeks. And could you blame them? A group of terrorists detonated a nuclear bomb, blowing Arasaka Tower to pieces. The terrorists' warning came too late – not all of the Tower's employees could be evacuated. The blast itself killed and wounded thousands, while countless others died from radiation sickness. How did the biggest terrorist attack in the 21st century happen? Who was behind this catastrophe? To find the answers, we'll need to first understand the context of that era.

The early 2020's was a period of unrest for Night City and anti-corporate sentiment was at an all-time high. In the epicenter of the city's lawlessness stood the Atlantis club. It was seen as an island of resistance against the powers that be, primarily megacorporations like Militech or Biotechnica – though a special place in hell was reserved for Arasaka, the Japanese arms-manufacturing zaibatsu that held the most influence over Night City. The kinds of people who frequented the Atlantis felt that corporations had hijacked the future and turned people into consumer-slaves and ironically, deprived of the two things capitalism loved most – freedom and choice. These people called themselves Edgerunners. They positioned themselves against the corporate world order – they declared their own freedom and opposition to the status quo. But deprived of any peaceful way to meaningfully change what they called "the System," they reached for more radical methods of self-expression. And these people were no strangers to violence.
