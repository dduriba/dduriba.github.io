Hey choom. Today is your unlucky day.

U prolly wondering who I am. I'm a Voodoo Boy, prolly heard of us. Remember last time you hit the Net? Yeah? Me too. I hack ur coprocessor and install a little surprise 4 u. Now you do what I say or your head goes BOOM.

I think €$1000 is fair pay to keep ur head. if u pay, I uninstall my surprise. If not, I blow up your head, but blow up the head of person you love the most first. And if you tell NCPD, I blow up your head TWICE.

U have 2 days to pay. And I know you read this cuz I install spycam in your optics. We read it together.

This is not a negotiation, choom, so do not reply. Just pay and u will live.
