I heard you came into some quality equipment recently and plan to keep it for yourself. I respect you, Lucious - a man needs ambition. But you're out of your element here. This equipment is hot and if you don't get it off your hands quicky... you'll get burned. I can offer a fair price for both sides and I can guarantee discretion. Think carefully.

It's all very simple. You'll get the number of the company transport which will already have the cooked papers inside. I sign off on the LOA (Lost on Arrival). Whenever customs officers see that LOA they know not to ask questions. And when company reps see the LOA, they ask far fewer than usual.

Have fun out there.

## Information on cDNA
{: .notice--success}

서버실 컴퓨터 파일

Militech's patented cDNA security system for Business and Premium class clients: cDNA encryption technology involves creating a unique client key based on user DNA and cyberware configuration (both hardware and software). Taking advantage of this method first requires installation of the Militech cDNA chip. The user's code is created at the time of chip authorization and is stored in a quantum state, making theft or interception nearly impossible. Should authorization fail, the code is immediately disintegrated. Militech ensures that it will not store clients' DNA and cyberware configuration data.

## (URGENT) MARKETING ISSUE

<span class="pen-bold">(Urgent) Marketing Issue</span>

<span class="pen-bold">From: Lindsay Barry</span>

<span class="pen-bold">To: Mark Robinson</span>

Mark, I still have a problem with the direction of this ad. It won't pass the focus groups with flying colors - if at all. What do we hope to achieve by advertising "milk?" I know you've seen the latest reports - even if we jack up nutrient content and tweak the consistency, we'll still lose to Biotechnica's alternatives. Our paste products already test worse with younger consumers. 

Besides, it's not even clear who the target audience is for this. You ARE aware most of our target sales are in urban markets, right? Unless you're playing off a sense of misplaced nostalgia or some reference I just don't get. 

We need to seriously consider reassigning the marketing budget from "milk" to something else. Do you have anything in mind from R&D that's already been tested?

L.

Lindsay, 

I'm not fully prepared to drop the milk project just yet - despite your first impressions, we've actually put quite a lot of thought into this campaign. Still, I'm willing to explore other options. We have the meat mixture based on insect proteins ready to go (the same we discussed last year but weren't happy with texture or smell). There's also a soluble powder based on mealworm larvae used as the base for porridges and soups - main problem there is we'd have to start from scratch. Let me know if either of these options speaks to you and we'll sync on the topic later this week.

## Orgiatic - Product Vision Meeting Notes
{: .notice--success}

생산층 구역 브릭 옆 방 파일

Notes after presentation: 
- settled on the name "Orgiatic" - tested very well, mktg and PR are in favor 
- have time til year end to nail down full product line flavor enhancement isn't enough, mktg suggests adding substance that allows us to brand it as "wholesome" mktg decision is focus on "premium" snack food, draw associations with movement ,energy, modernity artificial supplements? flavored based on mealworm larva - have fixed assets for it, low cost (but check with legal if we can list core nutrients w/o printing source)

## Orgiatic - Nutrition and Sales Approach Summary
{: .notice--success}

생산층 구역 브릭 옆 방 파일

Orgiatic will be All Foods' flagship, "wholesome" vitamin booster with accelerated absorption moving foward.

Unfortunately, we had to forgo using mealworm-derived powder as the paste base because production rhythm would not match with marketing assumptions. Even were that not true, we would prefer to avoid mutual cannibalization (both sales and public perception) between Orgiatic and other All Foods brands which already use mealworm larvae as the fundamental ingredient. Despite unforeseen obstacles, we continue to aim for at least 300% of daily vitamin needs, although exceeding this mark would most benefit the brand in terms of maintaining positive PR and increasing All Foods' market share in vitamin products.

We offer full access to our state-of-the-art technology, security(you won't have to relocate from Watson) and an attractive career path.

hey, saw that Zen master again (if he really even is a Zen master). he was sitting in front of the subway entrance. I waited to see what would happen - to see if he'd really disappear or if Sweet Peggy was just seeing things, but of course nobody came up to him, like he wasn't even there. seriously, though - you see a guy wearing Zen master's clothes and you don't even bat an eye? super weird. so anyway, I just stared at him. nothing happened, so I gave up. but the next time I'll nail the bastard. it's some kinda scam - gotta be.

Hey choom. Today is your unlucky day.

U prolly wondering who I am. I'm a Voodoo Boy, prolly heard of us. Remember last time you hit the Net? Yeah? Me too. I hack ur coprocessor and install a little surprise 4 u. Now you do what I say or your head goes BOOM.

I think €$1000 is fair pay to keep ur head. if u pay, I uninstall my surprise. If not, I blow up your head, but blow up the head of person you love the most first. And if you tell NCPD, I blow up your head TWICE.

U have 2 days to pay. And I know you read this cuz I install spycam in your optics. We read it together.

This is not a negotiation, choom, so do not reply. Just pay and u will live.

Dear Good Samaritan, 

I am desperate for your help. My name is Loviisa Kaukonen. I recently lost my job as a custodian at Euro Business Machines because I was in a horrible accident last May. Now my implants are no longer compatible with my nervous system. I lost function in both legs, right eye and my left hand. Surgery is too expensive for me. My daughter is very ill and my new baby is blind and deaf. It is my dream to show her the world, but I know I cannot afford treatment for both of us. I humbly ask you for a small donation to buy new Kiroshi eyes so that my little angel can see her mother and sister for the first time. 

I will not forget your mercy and generosity,

Loviisa Kaukonen

A certain corpo entered the Net one night when suddenly everything glitched and he encountered a red demon who said: "Tomorrow at midnight you will be dead." The corpo did not place any faith in the threat and slept soundly that night after leaving the Net. The next day, he went to work and returned home and nothing bad happened. But the next morning his daughter went to wake him up, his optical implants were burned out, his entire body was scorched and cut in half. If you break this email chain, the same thing will happen to you tomorrow at midnight. If you send this to only 3 people, the demon will hurt someone you love. If you send this to 15, the demon will follow you on the Net for 5 days but do nothing to you. If you send this to all of your contacts, your biggest dream will come true. 

It's true – it happened to my uncle!

I'm very sorry to send this on to you, but someone sent it to me first. It sounds silly but forwarding this email will save your life!

<span class="pen-bold">From: Sanne Douwes</span>

<span class="pen-bold">To: (ENCRYPTED)</span>

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Sanne Douwes, and I work for Wet en Rechtvaardigheid. I found your address on the client list for Zetatech's Dutch office. Your name happens to be identical to that of my former client, who died tragically in the recent floods ravaging the north of Europe.

Please excuse the rather informal nature of this email, but the matter is truly urgent. My client has left behind 10.7 billion eurodollars in cash. In accordance with local law, the government will assume the entire sum if an heir is not found within a week. I also have it from unofficial sources that the funds will be earmarked for the local branch of Euro Business Machines, which plans to take over Amsterdam.

But we can stop them. I know you are not related to my client by blood, but by taking advantage of a few legal loopholes, we could inherit his fortune and split it three ways - 40% for you, 40% for me, and the remaining 20% for the flood victims, of course.

Please respond to this message within 3 days. Otherwise, I will have to look elsewhere for help.

Sincerely,

Sanne Douwes
